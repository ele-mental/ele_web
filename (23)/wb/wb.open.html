(23) is many things.<br><br>
at its core, however, (23) is an artistic collaboration between like-minded individuals.  it is a project which attempts a coming together of the many methods of audiovisual and event presentation.<br><br>
(23) is also an ongoing project; an amorphous body of work and an undefinable artistic approach.  it is in this spirit that the (23) links page has been compiled. <br><br>
(23) organized another performance event, called <b>SENSE</b>, on 1 december 95.  the event incorporated live computer graphics, electronic music, and film.  in 1997, (23) has created installation ele_ments for various events including (PHYLOS) on 9 may, with several other underground projects in the works.  look under <a href="../../what.will.be.html">what will be</a> for more information on related <b>ele mental</b> events.<br><br>
