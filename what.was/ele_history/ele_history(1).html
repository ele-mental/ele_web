around fall of 1991, <b>todd sines</b> and <b>mike szebczeck</b>, followed by <b>titonton duvante</b>, began the band <b>body release</b>.  
soon thereafter, <b>charles noel</b> was asked to dj for the band.  in january of 1992 they played their first show, a low-tech multimedia extravaganza in the midst of a terrible snowstorm.  this auspicious debut was followed by several smaller gigs, including shows at a pizza parlor and at <b>acme art co.</b> art gallery. charles left the band to live in new york for a few months in the summer of 1992, but then returned.<br><br>

<b>body release</b> played several shows at clubs and at raves in columbus and as far as youngstown, ft wayne, cincinnati, cleveland, and even attempted an aborted show in chicago.  by late 1992, mike left the band, and the other three carried on.  the shows continued.<br><br>

<br> in january 1993, the three remaining members of <b>b|re</b> (that's
ele_lingo for <b>body release)</b> threw a house party which signaled the
beginning of a new era.  it is at this point that i (<b>edward luna</b>)
got more involved.  i had done some experimental new-age music with
titonton, and by his influence began to re-appreciate techno (especially
the music which was then called "breakbeat").  i showed some super-8 films
at the party in jan 93, and thereafter became more and more interested in
the band's music, and techno in general.  i started to do live film
manipulations during <b>b|re</b> performances, tweaking my film projectors
with old home-movies and other found footage. <b>tony ramos</b> became
involved shortly thereafter; initially with more basic visuals, later with
live video feedback and setting up computer workstations with which
partygoers could interact.  <b>doug holmes</b> and <b>kevin krahel</b>
also came along at about that time; at first by simply helping out at
several <b>b|re</b> gigs, then becoming more involved in djing and other
areas. <br><br>

to a great degree, this is the nucleus of people that has been responsible
for much of what has come since.  the long-term impact of the band (and
the small group of people that cared about what they were doing) has had
great repercussions on the columbus electronic dance-music scene, and is
still being felt (and growing!) to the present day <br><br>

in april of 1993, just as <b>b|re</b> and their related "elements" were
beginning to come together, a great opportunity arose in the figure of
<b>chris mohler</b>, a local metal sculptor.  by pure coincidence, mohler
had called called todd sines to express his interest in doing a rave at
his metal-working studio space.  several of the <b>b|re</b> cru (myself
included) went down to mohler's space and were very enthusiastic about the
possibilities.  the appeal was that we could do a rave with a strong
emphasis on both art <u>and</u> electronic music, not simply just throw
another "party." mohler, who was 36 at the time, was also enthused, seeing
a group of young people who were willing to do something different.<br><br>

<img align=right hspace=4 src="events/ele_mental/ele_mental.flyer.jpg" width=25%><br>
ultimately, however, mohler pulled out of the event.  he attended a local
commercial rave and did not like what it represented: loud music,
mainstream attitudes, and the general problems of the so-called "upscale"
rave.  mohler probably assumed that our idea of a rave was similar, so at
the last minute he ended his association with us.  <p> despite the obvious
disappointment, our experience with mohler only further galvanized our
belief that we could throw a "different" event like the one we imagined. 
todd decided that we didnt need mohler at all.  finally, in may of 1993,
todd organized most of the event which i named <b>elemental</b> (inspired
by a song on the seminal jungle/breakbeat record label <b>reinforced</b>,
entitled "the elements").  todd took the word and split it into two
syllables: "ele_mental," to stress the mental part of our mission.  the
actual event was held at a parking garage, and was a modest success.  this
event fueled the desire to do more events along similar lines, to keep
pushing the idea of the "party" into new areas.  this became the core
ideal of what was now being called the "ele_mental" project.<br><br>

<a href="events/comfort/comfort.gif"><img align=left src="events/comfort/comfort.chair.gif" border=0 width=20% hspace=10></a>the next result of this impulse to create events that are more than just
"parties," was an event called <b>comfort</b>, in june 1993.  again
spearheaded by todd, it was a two-room venture whose highlights included
tony ramos' very active participation, as well as dj sets by our good friends <b>paris mack</b> of detroit and <b>dave cooper</b> of toronto.  in keeping with the ele mental flavor,
there was an art gallery (featuring paintings by our friend <b>ann
heintz</b> of cincinnati) and the infamous "red room" (featuring a vintage stag film shown in amazingly-slow-motion; thereby changing pornography into surrealism).  the event attracted about 500 people, and was held in a warehouse owned by the ohio state university.  todd obtained permission from the university to use the space by calling the event an "interactive art installation."  the OSU administration was not amused after finding out what had taken place there, and punished todd for misleading them
(luckily, he only had to do some community service).<br><br>
   
but that wasn't the only problem.  the euphemism of "interactive art
installation," while not totally untrue (ie, the art gallery, etc), was
just untrue enough to disillusion some of us who were involved. 
<b>comfort</b> turned out to be far more of a "party," and less of an "installation" that some of us had envisioned (in
fact, it raised the polemic which has, to some degree, come to define many
of our subsequent events). <b>comfort</b>, while it attracted people from
many different crowds (rave/club/gay/art), it also proved the difference between "consumers" (who see parties as just that) and people who want to internalize the experience and take it to a different level (be it in the realm of music, art, visuals, or
even through drugs).  the future was to see this problem go through many phases, but other, more significant changes came first...<br><br>

<b>body release</b> broke up officially after one last "rave" performance
in aug 93 and an "unofficial" show at a bar in sept 93.  by this time, it
was clear that musical directions were diverging too drastically: each of
the musicians were basically writing their own songs, allowing little room for true collaboration.  yet despite the breakup, there was some optimism about musicmaking, and the three remained (and still are) friends.  this optimism was also manifested
at that last "unofficial" show, where tony first used his new toy, the atari video music (which has since become somewhat of an unofficial "symbol" of ele mental's use of low-tech equipment in new ways).  so at the time, in the fall of 1993, the concept
of "ele mental" seemed dead.  there were no more <b>b|re</b> gigs to be a part of, no more raves to be thrown (and no more spaces to be used, or so it seemed).  <br><br>

i then spearheaded the next event, called <b>snow*ball</b> (named by
titonton), thrown in dec 1993, in an attempt to encourage a spirit of
collaboration once again (incicentally, by now kevin krahel was spinning
by the name of <b>placebo</b> and doug holmes was called <b>doughboy</b>). 
<b>snow*ball</b>, despite its meager attendance of about 150 people, did
succeed in bringing the cru together.  it also incorporated (as always) unusual things for a "rave": experimental music, low-tech
visuals by tony, and a live feed to an internet chatline (called vrave)
which was projected on the wall in the main dance area.  so
<b>snow*ball</b> did succeed in some important ways, and it was an
important step closer towards the ideal of the "installation" which
<b>comfort</b> couldn't be.  it also attracted a crowd far more
appreciative of experimentation...people who were there for the music and
the experience, rather than just to be "seen" or just to do drugs.  so
with <b>snow*ball</b> much closer to "success" (if not monetarily, then at
least by some other definition), ele mental took a rest from doing big
events.<br><br>
