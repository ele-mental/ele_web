<br><br><br><br>

most of 1994 was spent doing house parties (including a series called
<b>spectrum</b> which tried to include djs from outside the ele mental
posse) and helping out with bigger events in town and out-of-town.  todd
and charles played as <b>a.mbience r.ecovery s.ystem</b> at several larger
events in kentucky and detroit.  we also did chill-out rooms in kentucky,
dayton, and at rob rage and mary's event <b>biosphere</b> in late 1994.<br><br>

many of us also stood by, watching the scene grow thanks to the influence
of rob rage (under whose auspices the first real columbus "raves" such as
<b>biosphere</b> were thrown), and the negative influence of drugs (which
made techno "fashionable" to some degree).  all of this was the reult of the commercialization and
pre-packaging of "the rave" (which had been going on for a long time but
had yet to infiltrate the actual underground scenes)...the result of which
was a massive influx of young people whose main interest was rebellion (and drug use), and perhaps the desire to
"fit in."  up till that point (in columbus, at least) most people that
listened to techno went to events because of the music, but after large
events such as <b>ackniculous land</b> in may 94 and and the aforementioned <b>biosphere</b> in oct 94, most of the new kids did not know about ele_mental nor our desire to communicate something more through our events...<p>

most of us ele_mentals were frustrated by all of this...seeing a
relatively intimate scene of music appreciators splintering into many
factions (who varied greatly in their intentions and desires).  also, the lack of spaces, and the relative indifference to which our events were received (compared to the monster turnouts at rage's events) were also important factors holding us back from doing another big event.  several of us did feel that it would be impossible to acheive what we really wanted: a big party that DID have a
deeper feeling, something that took the rave formula and pushed it to new
definitions.  todd, in fact, gave up and decided to focus more on his
music, design, and a new relationship. <br><br>

but despite our relative silence during 1994, one very notable thing did
begin: charles noel's <a href="../21/22/audio/fusion/">fusion</a> tape compilations.  charles compiled
the first one on a shoestring budget, gathering several ele mentals and
other midwest artists, releasing it in may of 1994.  <a href="../21/22/audio/fusion/fu02/fusion2.html">fusion 2</a> came several months later, and became a
true signpost for the future of techno and composers in columbus.  the
truth became more and more apparent, that columbus was less a town for
great parties and more a town from which

great music was originating. <br><br> <font size=2><b>FUSION 2 recording
