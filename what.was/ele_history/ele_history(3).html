but finally, one of us took the initiative: <b>placebo</b>, with great
help from his girlfriend michelle, decided to take on the risk of throwing
the first big event since <b>snow*ball</b>.  the event was called
<b>minimal state</b>, and it took place in march 1995.  placebo's thorough promotion (featuring a cool flyer by todd), a great lineup, and good business sense made the event the first unqualified monetary success by an ele_mental (and one of the few ever).  the event featured amazing dj sets by detroiters <b>mike huckaby</b>, <b>shake</b>, <b>bileebob</b>, indiana's <b>sho</b>, and chicago's <b>hyperactive</b>, as well as scorching live sets by todd (as himself) and charles (now known as <b>monochrome</b>). and again, the usual non-ravey touches: tony's low-tech visuals, another vrave hookup, and the live sets.  about 500 people came to the event, and the general feeling was one of optimism for the future.  we (especially kevin) had finally made our mark.<br><br>

<b>mantra</b> followed in early april, and was a collaboration between
myself and rajesh naik (under the name <b>aum</b>).  the event was a
4-room extravaganza featuring the likes of <b>juan atkins</b>,
<b>shake</b>, <b>dac crowell</b> playing live, <b>devil girl</b>, <b>phantom 45</b>, <b>brian gillespie</b>, and <b>dave
hollands</b>, among many others.  other ele mental participation included
live sets by <b>gaga</b> (an ambient/industrial band of which i am a
member, along with <b>mark gunderson</b>, <b>karen kreutzfeld</b>, and <b>gary xaoui</b>), <b>rich ratvasky</b> (<b>ihannoa</b>), and <b>myungho choi</b> (<b>elliptical</b>), tony ramos' visuals for all the rooms (including a live vrave feed again), and numerous dj sets.  the event was a very difficult one, and proved to be a learning experience; because although it was a success (ie, it broke even), it led me and others to feel that smaller events are the necessary way to go.  <br><br>

<b>red tempest</b> came in may 95, and was taken upon by doug, <b>jim
schaub</b> (<b>drift</b>, who had come aboard several months earlier), and
our good friend <b>ron</b>.  it was a rather large-scale event whose gears
had been mostly in place even as the lessons of <b>mantra</b> were sinking in.  it became a one-room event which faced great competition in indianapolis and other events the same night, but despite this the event nearly broke even.  the lineup included <b>nicki fingers</b>, <b>fierce</b>, <b>baggadonuts</b>, and a live set by titonton.  visuals were by <b>maxximum</b>, and were (as always) incredible, and tony ramos did a live video feed of the event to the net.  even though in some ways <b>red
tempest</b> was the most "ravey" of all the ele mental events so far (that's how doug and jim and ron wanted it!!), it still had something very different: a corridor full of games, coloring books, hula hoops, neon paint, and other fun stuff, done by <b>dee
abrahams</b> (<b>aphrodidee</b>) and <b>peggy sue evans </b> (<b>ladybug</b>), known collectively as <b>the technicolor dreamgirls</b>. <br><br>

everyone learned a great deal from the headaches of the larger events. 
they required large amounts of money which are difficult to happen upon
(legally), and the amount of energy required to put on such an event
became something that no one wanted to take upon themselves again.  and as usual, the problem of how to reach deeper, how to appeal to the music and art-lover as opposed to the "consumer, " continued to raise its head.  we hade made our mark with
these big events, proving that we could do as good a "rave" as the rest of them, but somehow it seemed pointless without that depth of emotion that was the initial impetus of our entire collaboration.<br><br>

so in the same spirit which inspired me to organize <b>snow*ball</b>, i
planned an untitled, small event for jun 30 1995.  it was intended to be a
more "intelligent" rave, without the need for a name or the typical
"ravey" overpromotion.  it was to be a modest, deep, different, event that didnt need to be called <u>anything</u>. it featured <b>dan bell</b>, <b>paul johnson</b>, and
<b>dac crowell</b> as the headliners, and numerous ele mentals spinning
and playing live.  in a financial sense, it was a dismal failure, becasue
of the obscure promotion and because of two very large events going on the next two days (<b>family affair</b> in cleveland and <b>fantastic voyage </b> in dayton).  nevertheless, in some ways it is the event which went the best (especially for me).  the point of the event was to bring things back to a human level, to a truer level of music and art which was the original spirit of ele_mental.  the live acts almost outnumbered the djs, the space was
decorated nearly to the point of it being a true art installation (thanks
to <b>kevin ginger</b>, <b>steve</b>, <b>sam</b>, <b>melissa</b>, and <b>jonathan</b> for the assist), tony did the usual vrave hookup and some fantastic video feedback, and in general the vibe couldn't have been thicker [we have a <a
href="http://www.hyperreal.com/~lunar/jun30collage.gif">collage of images</a> from this event, at hyperreal].<br><br>

the untitled event also marked a turning point, especially for me.  i was in financial ruin after the untitled event and worked all summer to pay most of the debts i owed.  i did not hold any resentment towards the scene, but i knew that the scene could no longer support the events i had in mind.  i still felt it was my responsibility to come up with something which the scene would support, and that i could afford to throw, so took on the leadership role again and
continued along these lines to throw <b>(H)</b>, the first in a series of live "ele_ment" events featuring live electronic composers from columbus (and eventually, it is hoped, from beyond). <br><br>

<b>(H)</b> took place in late aug 95, and featured music by <b>porch</b> (<b>andrew tweed</b>), <b>ihannoa</b> (rich ratvasky), and <b>a.mbience r.ecovery s.ystem</b> (todd & charles).  the event was essentially free, and about 50 people came out in the early evening to the site, which was a shelterhouse in the middle of a park.  for me, the event was a true summation of the ideals of ele mental: art and music, coming together in intimate events, on a human scale.<br><br>

part 2 of ths project was called <b>(He)</b>, on 17 nov 1995, and featured
the original members of <b>body release</b> in their own separate
performances...playing all-new music to a very appreciative crowd in the
shelterhouse at goodale park.<br><br>

<b>(He)</b> wrapped up by 11pm and was followed by the second in a series
of jungle/breaks/electro house parties called <b>persuasive percussion vol
2</b>, begun in oct 95.  this, as well as several other free house
parties, such as the ambient/weird party <b>swoon</b> in sept 95 by <b>jen ledenican</b> and <b>satya chheda</b>, <b>persuasive percussion vol 1</b> in oct, <b>sense</b> on dec 1 by <b>(23)</b> with <b>jeff jasper</b> and a live
ambient/industrial/computer-smash/fire performance by <b>gaga</b>, <b>sagittarius as fuck</b> (<b>kingSize's</b> birthday party), <b>dwellpoint</b> (a free new year's gathering), <b>persuasive percussion vol 3</b> on 12 jan 96, and <b>azure</b> on 14 jan (featuring detroit's <b>claude young</b> and a live PA by <b>powerhouse</b>), have been a positive experience in re-building a scene from the groud up.  most of the other "companies" and promotion crus in columbus have not been very active, and these parties served a real purpose in keeping the scene vibrant.  plus, the intimacy of the events has made the columbus scene a pretty tight one, emphasising friendships and music over drugs, fashion, or attitude.<br><br>
