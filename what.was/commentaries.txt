gallery hop is a roaring success thanks to warm, friendly weather, and ele_mental is there - represented by ARAMOS and RATFINK.  later that evening LUNAR represents with a 2-hour set at MAYDAY in cleveland, while .PLACEBO. and TITONTON make their mark at OPERATION LIBERATION on the homefront.<br><br>

FIREXIT 9 garners some media attention from THE OTHER PAPER (a local weekly), with firexit cru and friends shown on the cover.  the event itself is among the most object-oriented firexits thus far, highlighting installations by artists from the cranbrook academy of the arts (bloomfield, MI).  other highlights include work by jonathan smith (aka DJ SENSE), another brilliant sculpture by nathan hamilton, cory piehowicz's rough-cut video documentary "dan" (which arouses some well-needed laughs), low-key indyrock sounds by ASSEE LAKE and TIARA, and the ACTIVEnotPASSIVE concept, which comes alive again to close the night with some experimental soundscapes, featuring mark gunderson (keyboards), tim ramage (guitar, keyboard), ed luna and todd gys (turntables), matt clausen (drums), and mike "the redheaded one" (keyboards).<br><br>

<b>[3 april 99]</b><br>
the seventh ACTIVEnotPASSIVE event takes the rave formula to a different level.  5 DJs, a drummer, bassist, keyboard/guitarist, and noise artist combine with 5 experimental dancers to create an intense audiovisual experience.  not quite a party, not quite a concert, not quite an art show, but something exactly in between.   a great collaboration between ele_mental's ed luna, the firexit cru, and some open-minded dancers from the OSU dance department.  the performers include mark gunderson, angular, dreamcycle, lunar, and kenya dubois on turntables; matt clausen on drums; matt bailey on bass; tim ramage on keyboard, guitar, and drums; and the allmonster chorus.  dance organized by mara frazier and kate connely.<br><br>

the same evening tony ramos sets up at gallery hop again, this time with beautiful, cooperative weather.  as always a good time is had by all.<br><br>

<b>[20 february 99]</b><br>
ele_mental returns to the midsize-rave business with SNOWED*IN.  attendance runs over 600 people and by most accounts it is a success.  the space is divided into 3 areas including a hangout room with computers, a snow*cone machine, and art on the walls.  in the main room, detroit's SHAKE plays a brilliant live set in absolute darkness, and PARIS & BILLEEBOB tear it up with their tag-teaming action.  in the second room detroit's BRIAN GILLESPIE makes some noise with his blend of hip-hop, electro, and old-school funk, while the rest of the night is a free-form tag-team including great moments between PARIS, TITONTON, and DIVINE.<br><br>

<b>[6 february 99]</b><br>
ele_mental sets up at gallery hop again, creating yet another little stir with our "crazy beats."  a fun time is had by all including ed, tony, J.R., delcina, and dara, entertaining a very diverse crowd of passers-by.<br><br>

later that night (23) resurfaces to create an atmospheric room at CAKE, a rave presented by our friends at surreal productions.  this time out, charles and ed create some crazy musical landscapes with turntables, keyboards, a microphone, and various noisemakers.  sounds veer from harsh, to peaceful, to layered, to noisy, to quiet.  J.R. also jumps on to play some passive music as well.  meanwhile, tony brings out some cool games and a video drawing device.  returning to our roots, perhaps?<br><br>

<b>[31 january 99]</b><br>
announcing our monday night event MENTAL has officially moved to INSOMNIA, on n high st across from the OSU campus.  after residing at the sugar shack for nearly 2 years, ed luna decides it's time to reach out to new people in a new space.  everyone is encouraged to come out and check out our experimental-style music, it's free and continues from about 10.30 PM - 2 AM.<br><br>

FIREXIT 7 goes off nicely, with gallery sounds and an event-closing
tag-team by the ele_mentals.  other highlights include a very experimental
fashion show with stage and lighting design by FIREXIT, with clothing by
LEE LEI, a soul DJ set by ZAKKIYAH, and live bands BETARORIC and KOOSTARK,
plus some great artwork.<br><br>

<b>[16 january 99]</b><br>
The ele mentals set up 'sweat'shop, a second room at VITAMIN E, and rocked it with sets by PLACEBO, TJ, FBK all the way from North Carolina, and Tim Madonna. ARAMOS finished up the night with a four-hour marathon set.<br><br>

<b>[10 january 99]</b><br>
PLACEBO causes a ruckus on the decks down at the latest weekly event called END, at bernie's distillery (traditionally an indy rock venue, but what the heck!).<br><br>

<b>[31 december 98]</b><br>
charles noel (MONOCHROME) spins in london to ring in the new year.  there are last-minute problems with the venue but despite this the place is crammed with over 2500 people (which was only 1/2 what they had originally planned for!).  anyway, charles has 
a good time, and even manages to stop by reinforced headquarters to shoot the shit and score some more records.<br><br>

<b>[10 decemner 98]</b><br>
FIREXIT 6 goes off well, with much-improved artwork on display and a respectable reaction to _dutch harbor_, an experimental non-narrative film featuring live accompaniment. TWINE and BAMBUKE COMMANDO represent the electronic experimental vibe, and turn a
 few heads with their dark sounds.  meanwhile, the ele_mentals' usual lighter gallery-style fare earns them a few more fans every time.<br><br>

<b>[5 december 98]</b><br>
HOLIDAY HOP, the Christmas edition of Gallery Hop, was a lot of fun for everyone, and ele mental was sure to be in on it. ARAMOS put on his Santa hat and played non-stop for a capacity crowd that jammed the sidewalks during the 70-degree heat(!?!)<br><br>


<b>[5 december 98]</b><br>
LUNAR makes his way up to toronto to join forces with the public transit recordings posse, at CODE 416 RETURNS.  PTR is a family-style crew trying to bring hip-hop, drum-n-bass, and techno together in a low-key setting, as well as a resource for releasing
 music by toronto's underground artists.   look for more collaborations with the ele_mentals in the near future.<br><br>

<b>[28 november 98]</b><br>
TITONTON rocks detroit, for the poorboy's event entitled HARMONY.<br><br>

<b>[25 november 98]</b><br>
LUNAR plays for a record-breaking 4 1/2 hours at GOBBLE 7.  the third floor room was supposed to be for other DJs as well but ed ended up hogging the tables all night, playing everything from kraftwerk to samba to miles davis, while meeting lots of cool, 
interesting ravers and restoring his faith in the scene.<br><br>

<b>[23 november 98]</b><br>
MENTAL becomes the unofficial meeting place to discuss the state of the columbus underground art and music scene, from all angles including electronic music, punk/hardcore, and avant-garde art.  meetings include members of FIREXIT, MORE THAN MUSIC, and EL
E_MENTAL, but the floor is open to anyone.  discussions start before MENTAL, around 9.30 PM. all are welcome.<br><br>

<b>[14 november 98]</b><br>
TITONTON's performs live with vocalist LEAH HOOVER, violinist IAN JESSE, clarinet by NICOLE HASSOUN, a bass-cellist, and drummer at NAVIGATE.  the performance was marred by nagging sound problems, but the performers were very tight and the music shined th
rough.  stunning to behold, we hope T decides to do this particular set again in a more intimate setting.<br><br>

.PLACEBO. also plays this event, in a small (and extremely hot!) racquetball court.<br><br>

<b>[22 october 98]</b><br>
TITONTON heads off for a week and a half jaunt to france and switzerland, playing dates in paris, bourges, and other smaller cities.<br><br>

<b>[30 october 98]</b><br>
MONOCHROME DJs in brussels, belgium.  charles spends the fall semester in birmingham, england, doing an independent study in electronic media art.<br><br>

<b>[september 98]</b><br>
ele_mental undergoes some personnel and structural changes.  for more details read ed's anguished explanation called <a href="breakin_it_down.html">breakin it down</a>.<br><br>
