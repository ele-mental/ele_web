<b>november 1996</b><hr><a href="../who/titonton/">titonton</a> made a rockin' DJ appearance playing dark drum&bass on nov 9 at GET FREAKY in indianapolis, performing along with <b>carlos</b>, <b>frankie bones</b>, <b>nigel richards</b>, and our white trash friend <b>doormouse</b> from milwaukee's <b>massive</b> contingent.

<hr>

<a href="../who/titonton/">titonton</a> spun alongside <b> carl craig</b> 
at FIASCO REVISITED in detroit on november 30th, presented by our good 
friends at <b>poorboy productions</b>. in this, titonton's first proper DJ appearance in detroit, he played a diverse hard techno set that was well-received, and his attention-grabbing, aggresive style of mixing surely etched itself into the memory of this detroit crowd which is surely appropriate considering the profound influence that detroit music has had in titonton's own musical formation.

<hr>

<a href="../who/cnoel/">charles noel</a > spun as <b>monochrome</b>
alongside detroit's <b>rolando</b> in indianapolis on nov 30, at our friend <b>locutus</b>' event, entitled ASSIMILATION.  charles was taking over as <a href="../who/titonton/">titonton</a>'s replacement, who DJ'd at FIASCO REVISITED in detroit on the same night.  apparently charles had a rather rough time because the soundperson turned the DJ monitor off, deciding it was more important to chat with a cute girl than let the DJ hear what he was doing.

<b>december 1996</b>

<hr>

<a href="../who/titonton">titonton</a> rocked at RED ALERT in champaign illinois on saturday dec 7.  the champaign scene seems to have been in a rather awkward stage at that point but T was proud to have stood out with his (by now notorious) DJ style.

<hr>

<a href="../who/powerhouse/">kevin kennedy</a> played an amazing live techno music show as <b>powerhouse</b> at <b>justus</b> production's presentation of E.P.T. in dayton, on saturday, december 14.  ironically, near the high point of kevin's early set, there was a bomb threat and the building was evacuated and searched for about an hour.  kevin, of course, was pleased.  the event also featured <a href="../who/eluna/">ed luna</a> (<b>lunar</b>) spinning long DJ sets of deep atmospheric music in the basement ambient room, and was headlined by new yorker <b>heather heart</b>, our torontonian friend <b>adam marshall</b>, detroit's <b>rolando</b>, and many more. <hr>
<br>

<b>january 1997</b>

<hr> 

<a href="../who/titonton/">titonton</a> performed an impressive set of his
latest electronic compositions at <b>justus</b> production's cold, dirty, warehouse-style event called MUVEMENT on saturday january 11th, beginning and ending his set with unusual, non-dance compositions very reminiscent of his experimental work for earlier ele_mental events (not to mention echoes of the old "zalocar" performance of 1993).  the event also featured great music from chicago's <b>akilah bryant</b> (performing live), solid traxx from chicago's <b>DJ skull</b>, a beautiful mental set of minimalistic techno by detroit's <b>robert hood</b>, and a roof-tearing DJ set by <b>stacy pullen</b>, who seemed to be at his best. 

<hr>
<a href="../who/titonton/">titonton</a> spun in bourges, france, on january 25th, thanks to the promotional team of our friends steff and anyssa...marking the first overseas trip by an ele_mental.  by titonton's own account, the 400-person crowd was very appreciative of his energetic DJ style.

<b>february 1997</b>

<hr> 

<a href="../who/eluna/">ed luna</a> was supposed to perform as
<b>lunar</b> at MERCURY PROJECT, <b>tony nink</b>'s event in indianapolis
on feb 15th, alongside <b>kevin saunderson</b> from detroit, <b>adam
marshall</b> from toronto, and others, but the event was ended early and no second room was prepared.  ed wrote a short description of the history of detroit techno, which is featured on the back of the MERCURY PROJECT flyer, which was itself
designed by our associate, <b>aaron shinn</b> of <b>deep six graphics</b>. 

<hr>

<a href="../who/sines/">todd sines</a> performed a live show of his minimalistic traxx and techno music at another dirty warehouse event by <b>justus</b> productions, entitled INDIVIDUALLY TWISTED on feb 22nd in dayton ohio, alongside a DJ set by england's <b>neil landstrumm</b> in his first ohio appearance.  

<hr>
<br>
<b>march 1997</b>
<hr>

<a href="../who/titonton/">titonton</a> and <a href="../who/cnoel/">monochrome</a > were featured at <b>collective intelligence</b>'s THE RETURN OF SUPERFLY on march 1st, tag-teaming their way through some of the most influential and fun tracks from their own dance music history.  the event also featured <b>shake</b> from detroit, <b>dave hollands</b> from new york, <b>d-love</b> from orlando, and the entire collective intelligence cru. 

<hr>

<br>
<b>april 1997</b>
<hr>

<a href="../who/titonton/">titonton</a> tag-teamed with <b>divine</b> in the 2nd room and <a href="../who/eluna/">lunar</a> spun ambient drones in the 3rd room at JACKIN', thrown by <b>justus</b> productions in dayton on saturday, april 12th.  this time the event was at the boys and girls club, a space with a great deal of nostalgia for the old-schoolers who remember all of <b>the illuminator's</b> fine events there.  unfortunately things did not go very well for the justus cru...what a shame to see a space go.

<hr>

both <a href="../who/eluna/">lunar</a> and <a href="../who/titonton/">titonton</a> were featured DJs at this year's 420 event in cleveland on april 18, 19, and 20, and <a
href="../who/cnoel/">monochrome</a> performed a live set of experimental-style jungle and trip-hop, with our friend <b>jamalski</b> as MC.  also featured in this amazing lineup was our good friend <b>dego</b> from <a href="http://hyperreal.com/music/labels/R/">reinforced records</a>, <b>robert hood</b>, <b>aux 88</b>, sweden's <b>adam beyer</b>, and many many others.  despite the fact that it was at the agora (a played-out commercial theatre-type of venue), it was truly the music that made this event one of the best of 1997.  props to the promoters, tony (from chicago), steve cinch, and all those involved.

<hr> 
<br>
<b>may 1997</b>
<hr>
<a
href="../who/titonton/">titonton</a> and <a href="../who/cnoel/">monochrome</a> were supposed to be featured at the FURTHER festival in wisconsin, with a special appearance by our own industrial/tribal/ambient/improv band <b>gaga</b>, but the FURTHER concept was scaled back due to lack of a large enough venue.  next year perhaps?<br>

<hr>

<a href="../who/titonton/">titonton</a> and <a href="../who/doughboy/">doughboy</a> were featured at WICKED KINGDOM on may 30, presented in columbus by our good friends <b>the illuminators</b> from dayton, who returned to the scene with this party.  the event also featured european talent <b>oliver lieb</b> performing live as <b>spicelab</b>, <b>fred gianelli</b> as <b>the kooky scientist</b>, and <b>roland casper</b>.  regrettably, it was located at the valleydale ballroom, which still has a rather bad vibe after many mediocre parties there early on in columbus' history.  the late start and immense flood in the parking lot didn't help either, but it was nice to see the illuminators jump back into the fray after such a long silence.

<hr> 
<br>
<b>jun 1997</b>
<hr>

<a href="../who/sines/">todd sines</a> spun in munich (germany), and amsterdam (holland)...quite a trip for mr. sines!  during a brief stop in dusseldorf we hoped he would have time to stop by and see "ralf" and "florian" but there were more important things to take care of...
<hr>

<a href="../who/powerhouse/">powerhouse</a> performed a very destructive set of live hard techno at A HARD BLACK EVENING, presented by <b>black nation records</b> in kalamazoo, MI on fri 21 jun.  and a hard black evening it was, with pouring rain, and relentless techno all night from england's <b>surgeon</b>, <b>chris sattinger</b> (live) from minneapolis, detroiters <b>mike grant</b> and <b>shake</b>, plus hometown heroes <b>jay denham</b>, <b>baby pop</b>, and <b>d. knox</b>.  this was one of the most powerful events of 1997, by far.

<hr>

<br>
<b>jul 1997</b>
<hr>

<a href="../who/titonton/">titonton</a> was featured in a live performance at 
the 3-day FAMILY AFFAIR outdoor festival on the weekend of jul 4 in canton ohio.  due to a lack of organisation on the promoter's part, T ended up playing the main stage at 8 PM, so many people missed it, but by all reports it was one of his most incredible sets, featuring a new, hip-hop version of the melancholy track which ended his live sets at both CARBON and INDIGO, with <b>leah hoover</b> doing vocals.

<hr>

<a href="../who/titonton/">titonton</a> was featured as a second stage DJ at the <b>lollapalooza</b> show in columbus ohio, sun 21 jun.  this was his first opportunity to try out the new vestax turntables, and the reviews are not too great.  neither were reviews of the party, with its fakey embrace of "electronica."  did i mention that the second stage was in a tiny little tent?

<hr>

<a href="../who/cnoel/">charles noel</a> and <a href="../who/eluna/">ed luna</a> were guest DJs at club mekka on thursday 24 jul.

<hr>

<a href="../who/eluna/">ed luna</a> was featured as ambient/downtempo DJ <b>lunar</b> at RESONATE in springfield ohio, sat 6 sept.  this was another dirty warehouse event brought to you by <b>kimyon</b>'s cru, who always strive to make the chill room a regular fixture in justus-related events, and this one was no disappointment, with smoothed out tones and experimental noisy stuff all night long, spun by ed and louisvillian <b>j-sun</b>. the event also featured a rare live show by <b>dan bell</b>, with DJ sets by <b>alexi delano</b> and <b>rob hood</b>.  

<hr>
