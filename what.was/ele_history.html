luna)<p>around mid-1991, <b>todd sines</b>, <b>mike szebczeck</b>, and <b>titontonduvante</b> began the band <b>body release</b>.  soon thereafter,<b>charles noel</b> was asked to dj for the band.  in january of 1992 theyplayed their first show, a low-tech mul timedia extravaganza in the midstof a terrible snowstorm.  this auspicious debut was followed by severalsmaller gigs, including shows at a pizza parlor and at <b>acme art co.</b>art gallery. charles left the band to live in new york for a few months in the summer of 1992, but then returned.  <b>body release</b> playedseveral shows at clubs and at raves in columbus and as far as youngstown,ft wayne, cincinnati, cleveland, and even chicago.  by late 1992, mikeleft the band, and the other three carried on.  the shows continued.<br><br><center><font size=2><b>BODY RELEASE in early 1993: [from left to right] titonton duvante, todd sines, charles noel</b></font><br><br></center><img align=right alt="titonton duvante, todd sines, & charles noel" lowsrc="body.release.lowres.jpg" src="body.release.jpg" height=130 width=190><align=right><br> in january 1993, the three remaining members of <b>b/re</b> (that'sele lingo for <b>body release)</b> threw a house party which signaled thebeginning of a new era.  it is at this point that i (<b>edward luna</b>)got more involved.  i had done some experimental new-age music withtitonton, and by his influence began to re-appreciate techno (especiallythe music which was then called "breakbeat").  i showed some super-8 filmsat the party in jan 93, and thereafter became more and more interested inthe band's music, and techno in general.  i started to do live filmmanipulations during <b>b/re</b> performances, tweaking my film projectorswith old home-movies and other found footage. <b>tony ramos</b> becameinvolved shortly thereafter; initially with more basic visuals, later withlive video feedback and setting up computer workstations with whichpartygoers could interact.  <b>doug holmes</b> and <b>kevin krahel</b>also came along at about that time; at first by simply helping out atseveral <b>b/re</b> gigs, then becoming more involved in djing and otherareas. <p>to a great degree, this is the nucleus of people that has been responsiblefor much of what has come since.  the long-term impact of the band (andthe small group of people that cared about what they were doing) has hadgreat repercussions on the columbus electronic dance-music scene, and isstill being felt (and growing!) to the present day <br><br>in april of 1993, just as <b>b/re</b> and their related "elements" werebeginning to come together, a great opportunity arose in the figure of<b>chris mohler</b>, a local metal sculptor.  by pure coincidence, mohlerhad called called todd sines to express his interest in doing a rave athis metal-working studio space.  several of the <b>b/re</b> cru (myselfincluded) went down to mohler's space and were very enthusiastic about thepossibilities.  the appeal was that we could do a rave with a strongemphasis on both art <u>and</u> electronic music, not simply just throwanother "party." mohler, who was 36 at the time, was also enthused, seeinga group of young people who were willing to do something different.<p>ultimately, however, mohler pulled out of the event.  he attended a localcommercial rave and did not like what it represented: loud music,mainstream attitudes, and the general problems of the so-called "upscale"rave.  mohler probably assumed that our idea of a rave was similar, so atthe last minute he ended his association with us.  <p> despite the obviousdisappointment, our experience with mohler only further galvanized ourbelief that we could throw a "different" event like the one we imagined. todd decided that we didnt need mohler at all.  finally, in may of 1993,todd organized most of the event which i named <b>elemental</b> (inspiredby a song on the seminal jungle/breakbeat record label <b>reinforced</b>,entitled "the elements").  todd took the word and split it into twosyllables: "ele_mental," to stress the mental part of our mission.  theactual event was held at a parking garage, and was a modest success.  thisevent fueled the desire to do more events along similar lines, to keeppushing the idea of the "party" into new areas.  this became the coreideal of what was now being called the "ele mental" project.<p>the next result of this impulse to create events that are more than just"parties," was an event called <b>comfort</b>, in june 1993.  againspearheaded by todd, it was a two-room venture whose highlights includedtony ramos' very active participation, as well as dj sets by our good friends <b>paris mack</b> of detroit and<b>dave cooper</b> of toronto.  in keeping with the ele mental flavor,there was an art gallery (featuring paintings by our friend <b>annheintz</b> of cincinnati) and the infamous "red room" (featuring a vintage stag film shown in amazingly-slow-motion;thereby changing pornography into surrealism).  the event attracted about500 people, and was held in a warehouse owned by the ohio stateuniversity.  todd obtained permission from theuniversity to use the space by calling the event an "interactive artinstallation."  the OSU administration was not amused after finding outwhat had taken place there, and punished todd for misleading them(luckily, he only had to do some community service).<p>   but that wasn't the only problem.  the euphemism of "interactive artinstallation," while not totally untrue (ie, the art gallery, etc), wasjust untrue enough to disillusion some of us who were involved. <b>comfort</b> turned out to be far more of a "party," and less of an "installation" that some of us had envisioned (infact, it raised the polemic which has, to some degree, come to define manyof our subsequent events). <b>comfort</b>, while it attracted people frommany different crowds (rave/club/gay/art), it also proved the difference between "consumers" (who see partiesas just that) and people who want to internalize the experience and takeit to a different level (be it in the realm of music, art, visuals, oreven through drugs).  the future was to see this problem go through many phases, but other, more significantchanges came first...<p><b>body release</b> broke up officially after one last "rave" performancein aug 93 and an "unofficial" show at a bar in sept 93.  by this time, itwas clear that musical directions were diverging too drastically: each ofthe musicians were basically writing their own songs, allowing little room for true collaboration.  yetdespite the breakup, there was some optimism about musicmaking, and thethree remained (and still are) friends.  this optimism was also manifestedat that last "unofficial" show, where tony first used his new toy, the atari video music (which has sincebecome somewhat of an unofficial "symbol" of ele mental's use of low-techequipment in new ways).  so at the time, in the fall of 1993, the conceptof "ele mental" seemed dead.  there were no more <b>b/re</b> gigs to be a part of, no more raves to be thrown(and no more spaces to be used, or so it seemed).  <p>i then spearheaded the next event, called <b>snow*ball</b> (named bytitonton), thrown in dec 1993, in an attempt to encourage a spirit ofcollaboration once again (incicentally, by now kevin krahel was spinningby the name of <b>placebo</b> and doug holmes was called <b>doughboy</b>). <b>snow*ball</b>, despite its meager attendance of about 150 people, didsucceed in bringing the cru together.  it also incorporated (as always) unusual things for a "rave": experimental music, low-techvisuals by tony, and a live feed to an internet chatline (called vrave)which was projected on the wall in the main dance area.  so<b>snow*ball</b> did succeed in some important ways, and it was animportant step closer towards the ideal of the "installation" which<b>comfort</b> couldn't be.  it also attracted a crowd far moreappreciative of experimentation...people who were there for the music andthe experience, rather than just to be "seen" or just to do drugs.  sowith <b>snow ball</b> much closer to "success" (if not monetarily, then atleast by some other definition), ele mental took a rest from doing bigevents.<p> <img src=snow*ball.gif><br><br>most of 1994 was spent doing house parties (including a series called<b>spectrum</b> which tried to include djs from outside the ele mentalposse) and helping out with bigger events in town and out-of-town.  toddand charles played as <b>a.mbience r.ecovery s.ystem</b> at several largerevents in kentucky and detroit.  we also did chill-out rooms in kentucky,dayton, and at rob rage and mary's event <b>biosphere</b> in late 1994.<p>many of us also stood by, watching the scene grow thanks to the influenceof rob rage (under whose auspices the first real columbus "raves" such as<b>biosphere</b> were thrown), and the negative influence of drugs (whichmade techno "fashionable" to some degree).  all of this was the reult of the commercialization andpre-packaging of "the rave" (which had been going on for a long time buthad yet to infiltrate the actual underground scenes)...the result of whichwas a massive influx of young people whose main interest was rebellion (and drug use), and perhaps the desire to"fit in."  up till that point (in columbus, at least) most people thatlistened to techno went to events because of the music, but after largeevents such as <b>ackniculous land</b> in may 94 and and the aforementioned <b>biosphere</b> in oct 94, most ofthe new kids did not know about ele mental nor our desire to communicatesomething more through our events...<p>most of us ele mentals were frustrated by all of this...seeing arelatively intimate scene of music appreciators splintering into manyfactions (who varied greatly in their intentions and desires). also, the lack of spaces, and the relative indifference to which ourevents were received (compared to the monster turnouts at rage's events)were also important factors holding us back from doing another big event. several of us did feel that it would be impossible to acheive what we really wanted: a big party that DID have adeeper feeling, something that took the rave formula and pushed it to newdefinitions.  todd, in fact, gave up and decided to focus more on hismusic, design, and a new relationship. <p>but despite our relative silence during 1994, one very notable thing didbegin: charles noel's <b>fusion</b> tape compilations.  charles compiledthe first one on a shoestring budget, gathering several ele mentals andother midwest artists, releasing it in may of 1994.  <b>fusion 2</b> came several months later, and became atrue signpost for the future of techno and composers in columbus.  thetruth became more and more apparent, that columbus was less a town forgreat parties and more a town from whichgreat music was originating. <br><br> <font size=2><b>FUSION 2 recordingsessions, nov 1994</b></font><br> <img src="Fusion02_1.jpg"><pre> <imgsrc="Fusion02_2.jpg" ><br><br></pre>but finally, one of us took the initiative: <b>placebo</b>, with greathelp from his girlfriend michelle, decided to take on the risk of throwingthe first big event since <b>snow*ball</b>.  the event was called<b>minimal state</b>, and it took place inmarch 1995.  placebo's thorough promotion (featuring a cool flyer bytodd), a great lineup, and good business sense made the event the first(and only) unqualified monetary success by an ele mental.  the eventfeatured amazing dj sets by detroiters <b>mike huckaby</b>, <b>shake</b>, <b>bileebob</b>, indiana's <b>sho</b>, andchicago's <b>hyperactive</b>, as well as scorching live sets by todd (ashimself) and charles (now known as <b>monochrome</b>). and again, theusual non-ravey touches: tony's low-tech visuals, another vrave hookup, and the live sets.  about 500 people cameto the event, and the general feeling was one of optimism for the future. we (especially kevin) had finally made our mark.<p><b>mantra</b> followed in early april, and was a collaboration betweenmyself and rajesh naik (under the name <b>aum</b>).  the event was a4-room extravaganza featuring the likes of <b>juan atkins</b>,<b>shake</b>, <b>dac crowell</b> playing live, <b>devil girl</b>, <b>phantom 45</b>, <b>brian gillespie</b>, and <b>davehollands</b>, among many others.  other ele mental participation includedlive sets by <b>gaga</b> (an ambient/industrial band of which i am amember, along with <b>mark gunderson</b>, <b>karen kreutzfeld</b>, and <b>gary xaoui</b>), <b>rich ratvasky</b> (<b>ihannoa</b>), and <b>myungho choi</b> (<b>elliptical</b>), tony ramos' visuals for all the rooms (including a live vrave feed again), and numerous dj sets.  the event was a very difficult one, and proved to be a learning experience; because although it wasa success (ie, it broke even), it led me and others to feel that smallerevents are the necessary way to go.  <p><b>red tempest</b> came in may 95, and was taken upon by doug, <b>jimschaub</b> (<b>drift</b>, who had come aboard several months earlier), andour good friend <b>ron</b>.  it was a rather large-scale event whose gearshad been mostly in place even as the lessons of <b>mantra</b> were sinking in.  it became a one-room eventwhich faced great competition in indianapolis and other events the samenight, but despite this the event nearly broke even.  the lineup included<b>nicki fingers</b>, <b>fierce</b>,<b>baggadonuts</b>, and a live set by titonton.  visuals were by<b>maxximum</b>, and were (as always) incredible, and tony ramos did alive video feed of the event to the net.  even though in some ways <b>redtempest</b> was the most "ravey" of all the ele mental events so far (that's how doug and jim and ron wanted it!!), itstill had something very different: a corridor full of games, coloringbooks, hula hoops, neon paint, and other fun stuff, done by <b>deeabrahams</b> (<b>aphrodidee</b>) and <b>peggy sue evans </b> (<b>ladybug</b>), known collectively as <b>thetechnicolor dreamgirls</b>. <p>everyone learned a great deal from the headaches of the larger events. they required large amounts of money which are difficult to happen upon(legally), and the amount of energy required to put on such an eventbecame something that no one wanted to take upon themselves again.  and as usual, the problem of how to reachdeeper, how to appeal to the music and art-lover as opposed to the"consumer, " continued to raise its head.  we hade made our mark withthese big events, proving that we could do as good a "rave" as the rest of them, but somehow it seemed pointless withoutthat depth of emotion that was the initial impetus of our entirecollaboration.<p>so in the same spirit which inspired me to organize <b>snow*ball</b>, iplanned an untitled, small event for jun 30 1995.  it was intended to be amore "intelligent" rave, without the need for a name or the typical"ravey" overpromotion.  it was to be a modest, deep, different, event that didnt need to be called<u>anything</u>. it featured <b>dan bell</b>, <b>paul johnson</b>, and<b>dac crowell</b> as the headliners, and numerous ele mentals spinningand playing live.  in a financial sense, it was a dismal failure, becasueof the obscure promotion and because of two very largeevents going on the next two days (<b>family affair</b> in cleveland and<b>fantastic voyage </b> in dayton).  nevertheless, in some ways it is theevent which went the best (especially for me).  the point of the event wasto bring things back to a humanlevel, to a truer level of music and art which was the original spirit ofele mental.  the live acts almost outnumbered the djs, the space wasdecorated nearly to the point of it being a true art installation (thanksto <b>kevin ginger</b>, <b>steve</b>,<b>sam</b>, <b>melissa</b>, and <b>jonathan</b> for the assist), tony didthe usual vrave hookup and some fantastic video feedback, and in generalthe vibe couldn't have been thicker [we have a <ahref="http://www.hyperreal.com/~lunar/jun30collage.gif">collage of images</a> from this event, at hyperreal].<p>the untitled event also marked a turning point, especially for me.  i wasin financial ruin after the untitled event and worked all summer to paymost of the debts i owed.  i did not hold any resentment towards thescene, but i knew that the scene could no longer support the events i had in mind.  i still felt it was myresponsibility to come up with something which the scene would support,and that i could afford to throw, so took on the leadership role again andcontinued along these lines to throw <b>(H)</b>, the first in a series of live "ele ment" events featuring liveelectronic composers from columbus (and eventually, it is hoped, frombeyond).  <b>(H)</b> took place in late aug 95, and featured music by<b>porch</b> (<b>andrew tweed</b>), <b>ihannoa</b> (rich ratvasky), and <b>a.mbience r.ecovery s.ystem</b> (todd &charles).  the event was essentially free, and about 50 people came out inthe early evening to the site, which was a shelterhouse in the middle of apark.  for me, the event was a true summation of the ideals of ele mental:art and music, coming together in intimate events, on a humanscale.<br><br>part 2 of ths project was called <b>(He)</b>, on 17 nov 1995, and featuredthe original members of <b>body release</b> in their own separateperformances...playing all-new music to a very appreciative crowd in theshelterhouse at goodale park.<br><br><font size =2><b>TITONTON DUVANTE</b><br><br>

vol2</b>, begun in oct 95.  this, as well as several other free houseparties, such as the ambient/weird party <b>swoon</b> in sept 95 by <b>jen ledenican</b> and <b>satya chheda</b>,<b>persuasive percussion vol 1</b> in oct, <b>sense</b> on dec 1 by<b>(23)</b> with <b>jeff jasper</b> and a liveambient/industrial/computer-smash/fire performance by <b>gaga</b>, <b>sagittarius as fuck</b> (<b>kingSize's</b> birthday party), <b>dwellpoint</b> (a free new year's gathering), <b>persuasive percussion vol3</b> on 12 jan 96, and <b>azure</b> on 14 jan (featuring detroit's<b>claude young</b> and a live PA by <b>powerhouse</b>), have been a positive experience in re-building a scene fromthe groud up.  most of the other "companies" and promotion crus incolumbus have not been very active, and these parties served a realpurpose in keeping the scene vibrant.  plus, the intimacy of the events has made the columbus scene a pretty tight one,emphasising friendships and music over drugs, fashion, orattitude.<br><br>all of this culminated in our most successful event to date, called<b>snow*fall</b> on 2 feb 96, a "sequel" of sorts to <b>snow*ball</b> fromover 2 years earlier.  <img alt="snow*fall" align=rightsrc="snow*fall.gif">great moments included another scorc hing live musicset by todd and one by stephen, mc'd by detroiters brian gillespie andparis mack.  paris, along with fellow detroiter jon williams (billeebob),also made his triumphant return to columbus, marking a milestone in thecolumbus-detroit colla boration.  anthony shakir joined us as well,showing off his skills in an explosive dj set.  other highlights:  placeboand doughboy's well-recieved traxx tag team, gaga's exploratoryambient/industrial set in the 2nd room, brian's hip-hop/lounge set (als oin the 2nd room), and much more.  especially satisfying (for me) was thehigh attendance (over 550!!) who came out in 5-degree weather to supportus.  perhaps it was only a question of timing, but i felt as though thisevent proved that our message was finally beginning to be understood.<br><br>look under <a href="/~eluna/what.will.be.html">what will be</a> to findout what we have planned next.  and although the smaller event likesnow*fall seem to be the best way to send the message, several biggerevents are in the works (including <b>doughbo y</b>'s massive <b>generator</b> event with the UK's <b>dave clarke</b>, in april).  you canbet, however, that even our bigger events will continue to poke and pry atwhat the definition of a "rave" is.  to me, it's a place where one has themental spac e to lose yourself, while at the same time feeling safe enoughto ask the deeper questions about yourself and the world around you.  iwant to look for new ways of attaining this (and if you have any ideas youknow where to email me!)...<br><br>also, charles continues to work on his own music and on the next chapterof the <b>fusion</b> tape compilations.  todd continues to work withcharles on <b>a.r.s.</b> and has released several records on<b>peacefrog</b>, one on dan bell's <b>seventh city</b> label, and evenone on hyperactive's <b>contact</b> label outta chicago (released underthe name <b>trait</b>).  titonton has released an ep on<b>metamorphic</b>, stephen's record is now out on th e <b>jungle sky</b>label, and other ele mentals have music in the works...(including <b>kevinkennedy/powerhouse</b>,<b>kevin krahel/placebo</b>, <b>kevin ginger</b>,and more...) <p>so finally, ele mental has begun to truly grow into what its originalvision was: a loose affiliation of people who see art/techno/life as partof the same thing.<p>when time allows i will update this history further, in even more detail. i have written it for myself and for the cru, but hopefully some of youthat have read this far will contact us if you are down...there's alwaysroom for more people and more ideas
