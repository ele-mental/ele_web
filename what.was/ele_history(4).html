<img alt="snow*fall"

all of this culminated in one of our most successful events, called
<b>snow*fall</b> on 2 feb 96, a "sequel" of sorts to <b>snow*ball</b> from
over 2 years earlier.  great moments included another scorching live music
set by todd and one by stephen, mc'd by detroiters brian gillespie and
paris mack.  paris, along with fellow detroiter jon williams (billeebob),
also made his triumphant return to columbus, marking a milestone in the
columbus-detroit collaboration.  anthony shakir joined us as well,
showing off his skills in an explosive dj set.  other highlights: placebo
and doughboy's well-recieved trax tag team, gaga's exploratory
ambient/industrial set in the 2nd room, brian's hip-hop/lounge set (also
in the 2nd room), and much more.  especially satisfying (for me) was the
high attendance (over 550!!) who came out in 5-degree weather to support
us.  perhaps it was only a question of timing, but i felt as though this
event proved that our message was finally beginning to be understood.
<br><br>

although the smaller event like snow*fall seem to be the best way to send the message, several bigger events have already happened (including <b>doughboy</b>'s massive <b>
generator</b> event with the UK's <b>dave clarke</b>, in april 96, not to mention the latest gargantuan event called METAMORPHOSIS along with collective intelligence, which attracted upwards of 3500 people in sept 97).  you can
bet, however, that even our bigger events will continue to poke and pry at
what the definition of a "rave" is.  to me, it's a place where one has the
mental space to lose yourself, while at the same time feeling safe enough
to ask the deeper questions about yourself and the world around you.  it's about combining mental aspects of traditional artistic experiences with the bodily aspects of the party experience.<br><br>

look under <a href="../what.will.be/">what will be</a> to find
out what we have planned next.<br><br>

charles continues to work on his own music and on the next releases for the <a href="../21/">21/22 corp</a>.  todd has periodically worked with
charles on <b>a.r.s.</b> and has released several records on
<b>peacefrog</b>, one on dan bell's <b>seventh city</b> label, and even
one on hyperactive's <b>contact</b> label outta chicago (released under
the name <b>trait</b>), and in 1997 he has debuted his own company called <a href="http://www.corefilm.com/">core</a>.  titonton released an ep on
<b>metamorphic</b> in late 1995, and has recently collaborated with <b>morgan geist</b> for a release on the <b>phono</b> label from the UK, and has many other projects in the works.  stephen did music for the <b>jungle sky</b>
label, and worked with <b>r notorious j</b> in new york for the <b>rawkus</b> label. other ele_mentals have had wide releases and continue to work on new material...(including <b>kevin
kennedy/powerhouse</b>,<b>kevin krahel/placebo</b>, <b>kevin ginger</b>,
and more...) <br><br>

so finally, ele_mental has begun to truly grow into what its original
vision was: a loose affiliation of people who see art/techno/life as part
of the same thing.<br><br>

when time allows i will update this history further, in even more detail. 
i have written it for myself and for the cru, but hopefully some of you
that have read this far will contact us if you are down...there's always
room for more people and more ideas ...<br><br>
