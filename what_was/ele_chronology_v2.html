Ed,<br>
I have added some comments to several events, and added some new events as well. All changes and additions are <b>bolded</b>.<br>
<br>
I thought the list should also emphasize things ele_mental did which _others_ would find notable, such as important out-of-town dates, and events where we influenced others or made our presence felt outside ourselves.<br>
<br>
Please check the dates and places; my memory's not so good.<br><br>
