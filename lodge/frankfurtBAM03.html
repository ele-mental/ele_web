      <br>
      In the US, the dances created by William Forsythe and his Ballet 
      Frankfurt are known primarily for their contorted, geometric, and formal 
      qualities. This is contemporary European dance at its most obtuse and abstract; 
      with harsh, minimalist lighting, electronic music scores, rail-thin dancers, 
      and frequent use of text. Such experimentalism often receives a rather cool 
      reception here, where dance audiences are more accustomed to the lyrical/musical 
      style of Mark Morris, or the pastiched African-Americana of Bill T. Jones. 
      <br>
      <br>
      The Forsythian project, by contrast, is at once more ambitious and more 
      modest than that of the latter choreographers. Where Mark Morris evokes 
      a kind of baroque classicism, and Jones resonates with the sensibility of 
      jazz, Forsythe draws from such heady sources as the deconstructivist architecture 
      of Daniel Libeskind. At the same time, he celebrates the good old-fashioned 
      balletic body, and claims not to be overturning the paradigm of that form, 
      but rather simply going &quot;through&quot; it&#151&quot;adjacent, or beside, 
      or around&quot; it. In some sense, then, Forsythe is the quintessential 
      American pioneer in Europe: investing an old European tradition with a rock'n'roll 
      sensibility. <br>
      <br>
      In spite of this, the roots of his explorations largely bypass the traditions 
      of American Modern Dance, as represented by the lineage of Martha Graham, 
      Paul Taylor, Jos&eacute; Lim&oacute;n, Merce Cunningham, and artists of 
      the Judson Church era. Certainly, his work can be seen in a continuity with 
      these artists, but in Forsythe we see a genuinely European aesthetic at 
      work&#151;influenced by the <i>influence</i> of the American Moderns, perhaps, 
      but more in line with European traditions of deconstruction, Tanztheater, 
      avant-garde art and music, and classical ballet. There is no trace of the 
      archetypal psychodrama of Graham, for example, despite having sometimes 
      drawn from similar mythological sources. There is also little of the lyricism 
      of Taylor and Lim&oacute;n, despite an abiding concern for fluidity of movement. 
      And while there is certainly a great deal of partnering and physical contact 
      between the dancers, Forsythe's work betrays little influence of contact 
      improvisation or release technique. <br>
      <br>
      The closest Forsythe comes to the American tradition is Cunningham, who 
      engages in a similar dialogue between the classical forms of ballet, chance 
      operations, and modern music. However, where Cunningham absolutely decried 
      narrative and musicality in favor of an aesthetic of arbitrariness, Forsythe 
      is far more deliberate. Cunningham's &quot;collaborators&quot; worked separately 
      and were only put together on opening night. Forsythe, while using a great 
      deal of improvisation in his works, nevertheless shapes his work, making 
      decisions with the help of his dancers. He also helps design sets and lighting 
      and often works closely with Thom Willems, his musical collaborator. Forsythe 
      is also less afraid to engage the audience with notions of &quot;meaning.&quot; 
      His works offer a kind of open-ended narrativity that lies somewhere between 
      the &quot;closed&quot; meaning of story ballet and the radical randomness 
      of Cunningham. In either case, Forsythe is arguably more appropriate&#151and 
      more approachable&#151than either of those. <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      The rare appearance by Ballet Frankfurt at the Brooklyn Academy of Music 
      in 2003 was a sold-out run, attended by the usual audience of well-dressed 
      dance aficionados, but also by a whole new generation of moppy-haired hipsters 
      eager to take in some of Forsythe's much-hyped work. Rather surprisingly, 
      the program presented by the company was relatively straightforward dance 
      characterized by a clarity and joy of movement. This is quite unlike some 
      of the company's more recent work, which has made extensive use of text, 
      pedestrian movement, extensive sets, and other theatrical elements not often 
      seen in dance (such as the use of a cameraman who becomes part of the piece, 
      as I witnessed in 2003's Decreation).<br>
      <br>
      The opener, called <i>The Room as it Was</i> (2002) features four female 
      and four male dancers. The dance, which is a loving exploration of balletic 
      vocabulary, unfolds in a carefully crafted environment consisting of light-colored 
      scrim that bounds a brightly lit rectangular area on all sides of the stage. 
      The women, wearing point shoes, are the most clearly articulated, and Dana 
      Casperson in particular is notable for using her feet in sculpted <i>pass&eacute;</i> 
      and <i>attitude</i> positions. The dancers go through various configurations, 
      or &quot;scenes,&quot; creating solos, duets, trios, and so on. Often, the 
      remaining dancers leave the space during solos or duets, only to come back 
      and join back in. This constant shifting of dancers in and out of the space 
      appears informal, almost casual. In this, the piece shows some influence 
      of improvisation, of a spatial kind somewhat unlike the more internal style 
      that appears to dominate in the US. The dancers also use their breath and 
      body slaps as cues, creating a rhythm of breathing and movement which is 
      interesting for its constant inventiveness. <br>
      <br>
      The piece eventually shifts into a completely new setup. The back &quot;wall&quot; 
      of the bounded rectangle is slowly raised to reveal two of the dancers lingering 
      in an embrace, while the lighting shifts from dry and white to moody and 
      dark, and a piece of ambient electronic music fades in. Then, abruptly, 
      the piece ends. It is as if, by ending the piece in the middle of a thought, 
      Forsythe wants the audience to continue it on their own, in their imaginations. 
      Or, perhaps it is a reminder of the ephemerality of time; a reminder that 
      we cannot relive past experiences, as hinted by the title. <br>
      <br>
      <img src="images/duo.jpg" width="148" height="180" border="8"><br>
      <font color="#666666"><span class="small"><i>Duo</i> (1996)</span></font> 
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>Duo</i> (1996), featuring two female dancers in socks, black briefs and 
      long-sleeved, see-through tops, is the most balletic of the program. With 
      the curtain down, the dancers have only the front of the stage to perform. 
      Even with the orchestra pit converted to add stage space, the danceable 
      area is still quite shallow. The most striking visual aspect of the piece 
      is its brutally simple lighting. A line of specially installed fluorescent 
      lights illuminate the front of the stage and the front of the house from 
      overhead, lending the work a very informal, vulnerable feeling. As the dancers 
      are exposed, so are we, the audience, exposed. <br>
      <br>
      The movement itself consists of highly balletic motifs done mostly in unison, 
      set to a simple piano tune reminiscent of Satie's turn-of-the-century melancholia. 
      The rhythm of the piece is modulated by slight shifts in this unison, and 
      sudden collapses to the ground. On the ground, the movements retain their 
      balletic clarity and length, but also become more vigorous and animal-like. 
      The dancers recover from these collapses by coming back up, regaining their 
      composure, and starting anew, on <i>pass&eacute; relev&eacute;</i>. Shifting 
      and undulating with the subtle comings and goings of the music, which often 
      fades to near nothingness, the piece again ends abruptly. <br>
      <br>
      <i>(N.N.N.N.)</i> (2002) is for four male dancers. This time the movement 
      is more athletic, pushing the dancers to various extremes of speed, strength, 
      and position. Gestures and physical contact abound. One particularly memorable 
      image is of the dancers holding their heads in each others' hands and using 
      that as a point of departure for more tangled positions. The lighting is 
      minimal, as in the other pieces, which foregrounds the movement. By the 
      end of the piece, so much has happened that the audience remains almost 
      as exhausted as the dancers. <br>
      <br>
      The most striking piece is the closer, entitled <i>One Flat Thing, reproduced</i> 
      (2000). It begins with the harrowing image of 14 dancers shoving 20 large 
      metal tables towards the audience. The screeching, lumbering, mass of metal 
      stops on a dime, and becomes the grid-like set through which the dance is 
      elaborated. <br>
      <br>
      The dancers use the tables in every imaginable way. They mostly dance in 
      the &quot;channels&quot; between the tables, in front of them, behind them, 
      and occasionally under them. The dancers alternate between quick negotiations 
      between the tables, to occasional group formations that spill onto the tabletops, 
      before being pulled back down. The tables are slapped, shifted, and in one 
      case even used like a turtle shell, raised on the back of a dancer hidden 
      underneath. Nearly in the dark along the bare, back stage wall, other dancers 
      simply wait to reenter the main space. Meanwhile, the music is the sonic 
      equivalent of metal, consisting of churning, noisy, &quot;industrial&quot; 
      sounds that build and are seemingly disconnected from the movement onstage. 
      <br>
      <br>
      All of this cacophony does not take away from the subtle interactions between 
      the dancers, who sometimes appear to be cautiously waiting for their cues, 
      at other times, indulging in a guilty solo on top of a table. <br>
      <br>
      In order to take in all of these details, the piece requires a certain &quot;fuzzy 
      vision.&quot; What becomes immediately noticeable in that state is how carefully 
      the piece has been constrcuted: seemingly disconnected movements flutter 
      through the space, dancers clump together and dissipate, clear lines are 
      drawn out and then collapsed. The piece ends with the dancers collecting 
      the tables far upstage, and again pushing them down towards the audience, 
      menacingly. As with most of the pieces of this program, <i>One Flat Thing</i> 
      simply ends there, with the threat of whatever may be &quot;next&quot; hanging 
      in our throats. <img src="images/blackpixel.gif" width="7" height="7" align="absmiddle"><br>
