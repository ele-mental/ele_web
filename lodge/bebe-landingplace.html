        <br>
      Bebe Miller's work has long been characterized by its intimacy; a human 
      element that is often lacking in the cool or cacophonous aesthetics of the 
      postmodern dance era. Longtime fans may therefore be surprised by her company's 
      latest work-in-progress, entitled <i>Landing/Place</i>, which makes use 
      of some of the same technologies that have lent postmodern dance its air 
      of ironic detachment and conceptual messiness. <br>
        <br>
      Conceived in collaboration with The Ohio State Universities Advanced Computing 
      Center for the Arts and Design (ACCAD), the piece uses as its launching 
      pad a trip Miller took to the African country of Eritrea, on the Horn of 
      Africa. Beginning with an evocation of the trip in an onstage monologue 
      by Miller herself, the piece then gives in to a more internal dynamic. A 
      wooden birdhouse is visible in the center of the stage, placed on a short 
      wooden pedestal. On the right of the stage, a laptop and other electronic 
      gear is seen, sleeping. On the front of the stage, just to the left of center, 
      hangs a long, obtrusive rectangular screen which is semi-opaque. Throughout 
      the piece, this screen is used to project a number of images based on data 
      which was captured from Miller and her dancers. Other, more cinematic images 
      are seen in a smaller projection on the right section of the stage's back 
      wall. <br>
        <br>
        Amid this array of distractions, a dance piece takes shape. A brief description 
        of the first several minutes of the piece will serve to illustrate the 
        many directions the piece wants to go.<br>
        <br>
      Miller's monologue consists of some thoughts gathered from her Eritrean 
      journal, relating a story about trying to find a certain place. Her delivery 
      is carefully paced, but sometimes difficult to hear. It seems that the strict 
      meaning of the words is less important than her presence, much like the 
      effect of an &quot;establishing shot&quot; in film: creating a time and 
      space and emotional dimension to the piece. <br>
        <br>
      After her departure stage left, Angie Hauser, a fair-skinned redhead, scurries 
      out to the birdhouse set on the center stage floor. Clad in black dress 
      and red sweater, she crouches and guards the birdhouse possessively. Darrell 
      Jones, a slightly built, light-skinned black dancer, soon joins her. They 
      perform a sort of nervous courtship during which he takes off her sweater. 
      She appears to be hesitant, but eventually gives in. Meanwhile, the first 
      of many sparse projections is seen on the large front screen, consisting 
      of a field of shivering dots that we eventually come to see as a human shape.<br>
        <br>
        The musician, Albert Mathias, comes onstage, wearing black. He sits at 
        the laptop and begins playing a subtle droning sound. Eventually, Mathias 
        cues a distorted text of an arrogant woman discussing her experiences 
        in mistranslation. This gives way to another text, spoken in German.<br>
        <br>
        Soon, the duo is joined by a blonde-haired Kathleen Hermesdorf, who enters 
        quickly, executing sharp, off-balanced movements. Longtime company member 
        David Thompson also joins, moving more smoothly and sequentially while 
        clad in a striped shirt (making him look somewhat like a sailor or caricature).<br>
        <br>
      The four dancers nestle hips together in a single clump and then lunge forwards 
      and backwards repetitively, in a motif which will be seen throughout the 
      piece. Near the end of their &quot;step dance,&quot; the fifth and final 
      dancer, dark-haired Kathleen Fisher, enters dramatically from the right. 
      After performing her entering phrase, the other group stepping disputes, 
      forcing her to do the shuffle on her own.<br>
        <br>
      The projections are mostly discreet, and often appear independent of the 
      dance. On the large, long front screen are the images built by animator 
      Vita Berezina-Blackburn from ACCAD's motion-capture data. What at first 
      may appear to be stars or motes of dust hovering in front of the scene, 
      occasionally come together into human-like shapes made of dots. While these 
      &quot;dot people&quot; are a familiar image to anyone versed in the motion-capture 
      process (where dancers wear ping-pong-like markers that assist in transferring 
      movement data into the computer), we may wonder if what we are looking at 
      is a human body at all. With the help of Marlon Barrios-Solano, the figures 
      are manipulated in various ways. Sometimes, they are viewed from above and 
      below. At other times they are stretched, distorted, and blurred into impossible 
      shapes. Most hauntingly, the dots are sometimes replaced by other data. 
      Near the end of the piece, for example, the dots become profiles of birds 
      in flight, making a human outline appear to be a formation of migrating 
      birds. In another moment, a projection of birdhouses swaying slightly on 
      the tops of long poles is later revealed to be based on the captured data 
      of dancers simply standing and shifting their weight.<br>
        <br>
        The back projections, designed by Maya Ciarrocci, consist mostly of images 
        of people, including recurring images of black girls and street scenes 
        which fade in and out subtly.<br>
        <br>
        Mathias' music veers from atmospheric to highly rhythmic, and the score 
        is peppered with longer sections of recorded music. A long &quot;lemon 
        eating&quot; section is performed to an unidentified piece of popular 
        World music. In another, Mathias samples the melancholy opening chord 
        from Radiohead's &quot;Pyramid Song.&quot; His integration into the piece 
        is welcome and surprising. Sometimes he remains on the periphery; other 
        times he joins the dancers in movement. He does not always appear comfortable 
        in his movement, in part because he is dressed too much like a backstage 
        crewmember (perhaps a subtle color or costume element would help) but 
        the fact that he appears &quot;up to&quot; the challenge is interesting.<br>
        <br>
      Another notable element (already alluded to) includes the use of lemons. 
      In one early section, Hauser discolored a handful of lemons buried under 
      the birdhouse. She defiantly chops them up and hands them to the rest of 
      the dancers, who gleefully suck on the slices while shimmering their hips 
      back and forth. Later, the pedestal upon which the birdhouse rests is lifted, 
      to reveal another dozen lemons. The final image of the piece, in fact, involve 
      Darell Jones sitting next to Mathias and casually rolling the lemons onto 
      the stage as the lights slowly fade down to black.<br>
        <br>
        What does the <i>Landing/Place</i> add up to at this point? Clearly, it 
        is difficult to discuss a &quot;work in progress,&quot; but there are 
        a number of obvious concerns being dealt with here. For one, like the 
        subject of her last two major works, <i>Going to the Wall</i> (1998) and 
        <i>Verge</i> (2001), human relationships are of central importance. There 
        are a number of sections that deal with the relationships between dancers, 
        and unlike a great deal of postmodern dance works, these relationships 
        are unmistakably <i>human</i>, not merely ironic, formal, or spatial. 
        Miller's employment of Talvin Wilks as dramaturg is an indication that 
        there is some kind of narrative being worked out here, but at this point 
        it is difficult to understand what that might be. Unlike <i>Verge</i>, 
        we have no text to help us along.<br>
        <br>
        Also, the dancers often appear to relate to the (non-computerized) video 
        projections; connoting loss, the passage of time, foreignness, and distance. 
        Their relation to the motion-capture projections are less clear, however, 
        as the sheer size and placement of the projections tends to dwarf the 
        dancers, despite their relative sparseness. Perhaps Miller is trying to 
        articulate something about the &quot;loss&quot; of information inherent 
        to the motion-capture process, where only a limited number of articulations 
        may be transferred to the computer. <br>
        <br>
      Overall, the piece seems a little too &quot;sectional,&quot; and unclear 
      about its own choreographic &quot;throughline.&quot; There is a familial 
      vibe between the dancers, but too often they are cornered by the choreographer 
      into isolationist landscapes. One such moment involves Hermesdorf standing 
      behind the front screen, with stark Gary lighting and projections of water 
      on both screens. Yet we do not given much indication of why she is &quot;left&quot; 
      here so alone, and how the rest of her &quot;family&quot; might relate to 
      this isolation.<br>
        <br>
        The set also deserves some attention. There are many moments when there 
        appears to be too much going on. This in and of itself is not a problem, 
        as it asks viewers to develop a wider field of vision. However, this is 
        difficult when we are faced with a very obtrusive screen with technological 
        images being projected on it. It remains sadly true that given the choice 
        between the familiar (a televised image) and the unfamiliar (a composed 
        body moving through space), the audience's eye is often drawn to the same 
        old, projected stuff. <br>
        <br>
        An interesting side effect of this screen, however, is that images are 
        often doubled or even tripled, as the screen is just opaque enough to 
        be seen, not only on the back wall behind the screen, but also on the 
        dancers' bodies. Perhaps there is a way to integrate this &quot;accident&quot; 
        into the piece, thereby integrating the large screen as well.<br>
        <br>
      There is no doubt that Miller's latest is already an ambitious, impressive 
      work with something to say. It remains to be seen <i>what</i> precisely 
      it<i></i> is trying to say. At the very least, Miller seems happy to be 
      playing with so much material, which spills off the stage both confidently 
      and awkwardly. With its many crisscrossing concerns for humanity, togetherness, 
      loss, isolation, embodiment, disembodiment, technology, travel, taste, and 
      time, something intriguing and enriching is well on the way to reaching 
      fruition. <img src="images/blackpixel.gif" width="7" height="7" align="absmiddle"></td>
