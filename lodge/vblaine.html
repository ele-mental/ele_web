        Thoughts on Current Research in Dance</span><br>
         <br>
        <font color="#666666"><span class="medium">By EDWARD LUNA</span></font><br>
        <br>
        Devoting an entire ten-week course to only one of Laban's four Motion 
        Factors&#151;Weight&#151;may appear to be somewhat &quot;reductive&quot; 
        at first. Indeed, many students (myself included) have struggled with 
        the strict parameters set by instructor Vera Blaine and the Choreography 
        I course that she has pioneered since the 1980s. <br>
        <br>
        However, such a seemingly narrow pedagogical approach may offer hidden 
        rewards. <br>
        <br>
        Limiting one's attention to the matter of Weight should be of particular 
        interest to most dancers, as it is arguably the most &quot;embodied&quot; 
        of the four Motion Factors. Laban defines Weight as the &quot;[m]uscular 
        Energy or Force used in the resistance to weight&quot; (i.e. <i>gravity</i>). 
        In Maletic's reading of Laban's work (which also borrows from Jung),<a href="#footnote1" class="medium">&sup1;</a> 
        Weight deals with <i>sensing</i> and <i>intentionality</i>. In contrast, 
        the Motion Factor of Time is more often a question of <i>intuition</i>, 
        <i>decisionmaking</i>, and <i>rhythm</i>; while Space is a question of 
        <i>thinking</i>, <i>attention</i>, and <i>orientation</i>; and Flow is 
        a question of <i>feeling</i>, and <i>progression</i> (using sequential 
        or non-sequential movement).<br>
        <br>
        In Blaine's conception, Weight&#151;and weight sensing&#151;is crucial 
        for dance performance. She describes watching dance programs across the 
        country, in which many of the dancers are simply not &quot;in their weight.,&quot; 
        and merely making shapes in space. Laban might agree with this priority 
        of Weight, as evidenced by his simple assertion that<br>
        <br>
      <span class="medium">It is a mechanical fact that the <i>weight</i> of the 
      body, or any of its parts, can be lifted and carried into a certain direction 
      of <i>space</i>, and that this process takes a certain amount of <i>time</i>. 
      . . . [t]he same. . . can also be observed in any counter-pull which regulates 
      the <i>flow</i> of movement.<a href="#footnote1">&sup2;</a></span><br>
        <br>
        In this brief article, I will attempt to summarize a few of Blaine's concepts, 
        with examples from my observation and/or participation in the class. I 
        will also outline the relevance of these materials to my own area of research: 
        the Brazilian dance-fight-game known as <i>capoeira</i>.<br>
        <br>
        <b>THE THREE WEIGHT QUALITIES</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Resiliency<br>
      </b>In Laban¹s scheme, resiliency is not classified as a distinct Effort 
      Element of Weight, but rather as a type of <i>phrasing</i> that alternates 
      between Strength and Lightness. Strength is defined as that which <i>resists</i> 
      and goes <i>against</i> the pull of gravity, while Lightness is that which 
      <i>refines</i> and <i>adjusts</i> to gravity (Laban also uses the useful 
      terms Resistance and Levity).<a href="#footnote1" class="medium">&sup3;</a> 
      Resiliency is therefore a way of moving between these two extremes.<br>
        <br>
      The resiliency that Blaine imparts on her students is of a slightly different 
      kind. In class exercises, she asks students to drop the weight on the body, 
      all the way down to &quot;the bottom.&quot; Having reached this bottom, 
      the body must re-engage to come up, finding a moment of levity (or &quot;overcurve&quot;) 
      before coming back down. For many students, this immediately translates 
      to a kind of &quot;bounciness.&quot; However, Blaine appears to prefer a 
      more subtle and complex kind of movement. In this, Blaine is combining aspects 
      of all three types of resiliency, defined by Maletic and others as <i>buoyant</i>, 
      <i>weighted</i>, and <i>elastic</i>.<a href="#footnote1" class="medium">&sup4;</a> 
      <br>
        <br>
        Buoyant resiliency might appear like a basketball being bounced off the 
        ground quickly and strongly, going high in the air and hanging for a moment, 
        before falling back down. Weighted resiliency might be that same basketball 
        as its bounces decrease in size and eventually give into gravity. Elastic 
        resiliency is the ball being dribbled constantly and evenly by a player. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In outlining her choreographic approach, Blaine uses all three types to 
        encourage her students to find their own developments and contrasts. <br>
      There are sections for raveling, floor, aerial, and minimal uses of resiliency, 
      each of which may demand different approaches. For example, buoyant resiliency 
      may be more appropriate for leaving the ground. Weighted resiliency may 
      be better suited for floor or minimal material. Elastic resiliency may be 
      suitable for traveling. <br>
        <br>
        Resiliency (especially of the elastic kind) is often given over to repetition, 
        which often serves to &quot;obscure choreographic difference,&quot; as 
        Blaine says. It also has an affinity with symmetry and alternation, which 
        again is predictable. As a suggestion, Blaine asks her students to insert 
        some temporal or spatial surprises into such predictable patterns.<br>
        <br>
        Resiliency also resides in the vertical plane, living in a constant up-down 
        dimension. Blaine also emphasizes the importance of connecting to the 
        center of weight, which is below the navel. Finding one's deep <i>pli&eacute;</i>, 
        and being able to reengage the weight from that lowered position, are 
        perhaps the keys to mastering resilient movement. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Strength<br>
      </b>The Effort Element of Strength is defined in Laban¹s terms as going 
      <i>against</i> the pull of gravity. It is stressed, tense, and firm.<a href="#footnote1" class="medium">&sup5;</a> 
      Maletic uses the words &quot;solid&quot; and &quot;forceful.&quot;<a href="#footnote1" class="medium">&sup6;</a> 
      While none of these imply directionality, one example by Cecily Dell begins 
      to suggest that it may exist in the horizontal plane: <br>
        <span class="medium"><br>
      If you have a heavy object to move, a heavy carton or piece of furniture, 
      you may have to engage your weight using a forceful quality. If you lean 
      against the object, giving in to your body weight, the object may not budge. 
      Probably you will have to get behind your weight and really push.<a href="#footnote1" class="medium">&sup7;</a></span><br>
        <br>
      Blaine uses this kind of imagery as a point of departure for her own conception 
      of Strength, in which the body pushes <i>out and through</i> gravity, very 
      resolutely in the horizontal plane. Laban himself makes little mention of 
      this horizontality, and in fact links Strength with jumping. He also discusses 
      Strength in terms of weightiness, or being heavy, which implies a vertical 
      axis.<span class="medium"><a href="#footnote1" class="medium">&sup8;</a></span> 
      But from a pedagogical point of view, it provides an excellent counterpoint 
      to the vertical nature of resiliency.<br>
        <br>
        Where resiliency is a constant giving in and renewing of weight, lending 
        it a rubbery, more Indirect feel, Strength is often very grounded and 
        direct. Blaine likes to emphasize oppositional pull, or a sense that if 
        a movement is thrusting forward, then it is also being pulled by an equal 
        and opposite force going backwards. In Strength, the body is always centered 
        on and reinitiating from the center of weight, and there are no half-measures. 
        Every step must be engaged (not necessarily &quot;tense&quot;), and the 
        dancer should never step under the body, but rather always out, :&quot;going 
        somewhere&quot; with the weight. Even the aerial section is not so much 
        &quot;up in the air&quot; as it is out through the space. Strength also 
        lends itself to impactful movements and gestures, which must come from 
        the center, not the periphery. One significant variation is called &quot;free 
        strength&quot; which is very Indirect, almost like flailing.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Lightness<br>
        </b>Laban defines Lightness as delicacy and refinement of weight. In terms 
        of the course, it &quot;lives at the top² of resiliency. In this, it closely 
        resembles the <i>port de bras</i> of ballet, with its &quot;indulgent,&quot; 
        refined quality of movement. <br>
        <br>
      Blaine refers to &quot;processing&quot; of the weight, which resides in 
      the vertical. The weight of the body does not give in to gravity, in this 
      case, but rather delicately ramifies it, pulling out suspensions at the 
      top of the movement.<br>
        <br>
      In another contrast to resiliency, there is less emphasis on the center 
      of gravity, and more on the &quot;center of levity,&quot; near the sternum. 
      As Dell notes, &quot;Activation in the chest, sternum, ribs, and upper back 
      with the support from the lower trunk, provide optimum conditions for producing 
      lightness.&quot;<span class="medium"><a href="#footnote1" class="medium">&sup9;</a></span><br>
        <br>
        Lightness lends itself to swing-like movements, very similar to buoyant 
        resiliency. It also lends itself to movements that rise and use the feet 
        carefully in <i>relev&eacute;</i>, sequencing through the body as it processes 
        the weight. To avoid binding the weight, Blaine reminds her students not 
        to &quot;perch&quot; above oneself, carefully balanced, but rather to 
        allow the body to fall off balance in order to sense the weight and reinitialize 
        its refinement.<br>
        <br>
        One different variation is called &quot;quick light.&quot; In this kind 
        of Lightness, the dancer uses movements that Laban would describe as &quot;flicking&quot;; 
        or &quot;fluttering,&quot; &quot;flapping,&quot; and &quot;whisking.&quot; 
        One helpful image is of walking over hot coals.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SOME OVERALL IMPLICATIONS <br>
        </b><br>
        The class presents quite a challenge to some dancers, who may be used 
        to moving in a certain way. By honing in on some of these habits, dancers 
        are offered an opportunity to begin to identify their own tendencies. 
        With some reflection, dancers may then challenge themselves to change 
        their movements appropriately. Even if the lessons learned in the class 
        are ultimately discarded, each dancer will have begun to develop a vocabulary 
        for describing movement that is not merely spatial, but addresses the 
        factor of Weight. This is of great use not only to the dancer, but also 
        the the choreographer looking for something more specific in a dancer. 
        It also begins to elaborate a knowledge of phrasing, which will be further 
        developed by other classes. <br>
        <br>
        <b>IMPLICATIONS FOR MY RESEARCH <br>
        </b><br>
        My own research is twofold. Firstly, I consider myself a choreographer 
        and mover, so the tools provided by this class are invaluable for the 
        embodiment and transmission of movement. Secondly, I am currently engaged 
        in a deep investigation of the Afro-Brazilian dance-fight-game known as 
        <i>capoeira</i>. It is to this second area of research that I will now 
        turn my attention. <br>
        <br>
      Capoeira is a notoriously heterogeneous field, as is appropriate for a form 
      that arrived in Brazil thanks to the institution of slavery, developed in 
      a slave context, was repressed, and survived into the 20th century only 
      to be modernized, stylized, and &quot;whitened.&quot; As such, it is difficult 
      to make generalizations about the form. Nevertheless, I will note here some 
      observations in my own learning, and teaching of the form. <br>

        <br>
        <b>Capoeira Angola<br>
        </b>In the more traditional style of<i> capoeira angola</i>, movers frequently 
        appear to use a kind of elastic resiliency to surprise their opponents. 
        This appearance of bounciness, where the weight is constantly shifting, 
        is deceptive not only for the opponent, but also for the academic observer. 
        This supposed elasticity, when closer examined, is actually closer to 
        passive, pedestrian weight (what Dell calls &quot;heaviness&quot;), or 
        even weighted resiliency. <br>
        <br>
      A key concept in capoeira, <i>malícia</i> (or &quot;treachery&quot;), helps 
      us understand this deception. Use of passive/elastic weight is a common 
      feature of many African-American dances. In capoeira, this translates to 
      a loose, resilient, and flexible bodily attitude that is nevertheless rooted 
      to the earth, weighted and fully aware of where its weight is. Without that 
      awareness, a <i>capoeira angola</i> player would easily be tripped. In other 
      words, the body is oriented to the vertical axis, always &quot;under itself,&quot; 
      even when low to the ground, or inverted, with hands on the ground. <br>
        <br>
      The appearance of resiliency also offers the practitioner immediate access 
      to qualities of Strength and Lightness. Resiliency lends itself to unpredictable 
      shifts of weight from one foot to another; so if one player cannot identify 
      precisely where the other has committed the weight of the body, the origin 
      of a surprise attack will be much more difficult to &quot;read.&quot; This 
      is a huge advantage for an attacker.<br>
        <br>
        The use of resilient phrasing is also useful in two other extremes: <i>following 
        through</i> on the attack (as in a real fight), as well as <i>holding 
        back</i> the attack (as in training, or a friendly match). When originating 
        in resiliency, a Sudden, Strong, attack may be particularly surprising 
        and devastating, because it is not &quot;broadcast&quot; as clearly as 
        a Strong, Direct attack would be from a neutral body position. Moreover, 
        the upward momentum of recovery in resiliency may be honed in to the horizontality 
        of Strength. On the other hand, when it is necessary to hold back an attack, 
        resiliency is drawn out at the &quot;top&quot; (or periphery of the movement) 
        and softened and controlled into a kind of Bound Lightness that avoids 
        impact.<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <b>Capoeira Regional<br>
      </b>In the more martial style of <i>copier regional</i>, Weight is markedly 
      different. Here, the mover appears to be using Strength, not resiliency, 
      to move through space. The mover rarely steps ³under² her/himself, and instead 
      usually steps quite far away from the center of weight. This makes the mover 
      more unbalanced and vulnerable to takedowns, but it also provides the attacks 
      with far more power and speed. It also allows more aerial movements to occur, 
      including death-defying acrobatics.<br>
        <br>
        In <i>capoeira regional</i>, many movers actually use some elastic resiliency, 
        bouncing rhythmically with the legs as they move from side to side and 
        back to front (see photo above). In this sense, the feet of the <i>regional</i> 
        player share some of the elastic resiliency of a boxer's feet, for example. 
        However, the <i>regional</i> player's legs are far more rhythmic and predictable 
        in their placement, which makes them vulnerable to attacks that interrupt 
        this rhythm. This is a weakness well understood by longtime practitioners, 
        who adapt some of the unpredictability of <i>angola</i> into their own 
        games, but I have often witnessed beginning and intermediate students 
        so determined to stay &quot;in rhythm&quot; that they were incredibly 
        predictable and therefore vulnerable to surprise.<br>
        <br>
        In contrast, the feet of the <i>angola</i> player are rarely far from 
        the center of weight, are are far less predictable. They are also more 
        generally weighted, almost &quot;neutral,&quot; which is suitable for 
        their supposed attitude of ambivalence. For the <i>angola</i> player, 
        the notion of &quot;pretending to cooperate&quot; while being ready to 
        attack, is a high art developed from years of learning to cope with slavery. 
        <i>Regional</i>, on the other hand, is taught less as an African cultural 
        form and more as a Brazilian martial art. Its use of the quality of Weight 
        would seem to conform to this generalization.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Photographic evidence<br>
        </b>These tendencies may be seen clearly in the photograph that heads 
        this article. The older gentleman on the left appears more balanced, centered, 
        and in relatively passive weight. The younger man doing the cartwheel 
        is exposing his belly, and very much projecting his weight through the 
        horizontal plane. I shall leave it up to the intelligent reader to determine 
        which of these is in a safer position (!).<br>
        <br>
      As noted in the <i>regional</i> photo above, the stance is very wide, and 
      clearly has a strong spatial intention. From this position, attacks may 
      be executed with great ferocity and speed (imagine how powerfully one go 
      those back legs could kick), but they risk being unbalanced. Notice too, 
      how all the students are performing the movement at the same time, which 
      is more uncommon in the <i>angola</i> schools. <br>
        <br>
      By contrast, note how in the <i>angola</i> photograph the players appear 
      clearly balanced. The older gentleman executing the kick on the left may 
      seem to be in a precarious position, but upon closer examination, the leg 
      is very clearly planted under him. Meanwhile, the student below has executed 
      a proper defense by going back and away from the attack, while still very 
      much balanced over himself, on his hands.<br>
        <br>
        These are only preliminary findings, but they indicate some of the interesting 
        implications of a detailed study of the Weight Factor (and all the other 
        Factors: Time, Space, Flow) in my own work.<br>
