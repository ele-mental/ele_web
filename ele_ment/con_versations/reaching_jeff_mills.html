                <br>
                <b>BL::</b> Do you miss the name 'Underground Resistance'? <br>
                <br>
                <b>JM::</b> Well, I liked the idea of starting over from the beginning. 
                The whole outfit was in Detroit - we had a building, offices, 
                employees, the t-shirts and all that mess. So I said 'You take 
                all this and most of the money'. I took just enough to start a 
                new label. Back in Detroit, we did all the tracks together. In 
                the last phase of UR, he (Mike Banks) was on tour and I sat in 
                the studio alone once. That's when I did 'the Punisher' and 'the 
                Seawolf'. Detroit is a depressing city. The feel there is kinda 
                dreamy. After the split, I was in a different city, New York, 
                and my sound changed at that time. It was a really different vibe. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>BL::</b> You played also played at raves and clubs all over 
                Europe lately, but have you played in Detroit recently? <br>
                <br>
                <b>JM::</b> There are a few smaller parties happening there. About 
                once or twice a year. But they are always very good. <br>
                <br>
                <b>BL::</b> What style of music is being played? <br>
                <br>
                <b>JM::</b> Mostly Detroit Techno, but also House and Garage and 
                some European stuff. In Chicago, rough house, Jack, is still the 
                shit, while New York is still Garage; Detroit is right in between 
                these two cities - on the map as well as musicwise - so everything 
                in between is played there. Detroit is a bit finer than Chicago, 
                not that 'down-low' - the sound is more orchestrated, no use of 
                'Pussy'-lyrics and so on...maybe because the musical history of 
                Detroit. Motown and all those labels were putting out highly sophisticated 
                music back then - when I was younger. That was a very exciting 
                time. <br>
                <br>
                <b>BL::</b> Is there a scene for Detroit Techno in Detroit? <br>
                <br>
                <b>JM::</b> Oh, Rap is so strong everywhere in the states, but 
                especially in Detroit. That's what the kids listen to. Although 
                there is such a huge background for Techno, the scene is very 
                small. In Germany, the most influential city is Berlin. Frankfurt 
                and the area have some good producers, too, but I like the nature 
                of life in Berlin better. It's looser, kinda New Yorkish and the 
                most impacting records come from there. <br>
                <br>
                <b>BL::</b> Do you have any favorite producers in Germany? <br>
                <br>
                <b>JM::</b> I like all the Maurizio material and 3 Phase's stuff. 
                Also, the music Tanith played some years ago was cool, but now....you 
                know. I did a remix for Maurizio, on Basic Channel 01, too. But 
                I am careful with remixing. When you take an idea off someone 
                and change it to make something better out of it, it is always 
                a bit arrogant. If you have a good idea, put it on record by yourself 
                and release it with your name on it. That's it. It might be interesting, 
                though, to remix a record from another category - a rock record 
                for example. You have those two sounds - your's and their's - 
                and create something new, something in-between. <br>
                <br>
                <b>BL::</b> Do you also like playing over here - at the moment 
                it is all about playing hits. Do you play any? <br>
                <br>
                <b>JM::</b> Well, as long as it is a bad track - I got to play 
                it. If it sounds like shit - I don't, whether it is House, Techno, 
                even Gabber. I have to keep the people moving. Sometimes you have 
                to check out the vibe at a certain party within 3 records. It 
                is a lot of trial and error on my side most people do not see. 
                Some DJs have a planned set - I don't. I always try to play a 
                special mix for the night. If a large amount of people like a 
                particular record, there's nothing you can do - take Jaydee or 
                The Goodmen for example. Their records were the shit. Whether 
                they were hits or not. Everybody liked them. But there are still 
                records that are totally out of question. I cannot play hard all 
                night, too, because I don't want to. I know there are times it 
                is wise to play Gabber. But then it is also wise to break it down, 
                to give people a rest. You know, nights can stretch for 3 days, 
                especially in Germany. And then there are 20 DJs with all the 
                same records. <br>
                <br>
                I like to have a transition in my set. I always play house if 
                I can, mixing it in, so it's more like a party. Too much of one 
                thing becomes stupid quickly - and you are giving the people exactly 
                what they want. You are following the people instead vice versa. 
                It is hard to break the music down like that. A perfect set would 
                be when I can play all my favorite records and the people are 
                still there. When they scream off to a hot house record and a 
                hot Gabber record at the same party. There are no limits in BPMs 
                either. If you can do a transition, it works. Germany is not like 
                that. The only place I can play like this is Scotland, and some 
                places in London. <br>
                <br>
                That's how the parties are in the States, too - even the normal, 
                no-techno parties. The night is structured. Parties are over at 
                about 2AM most of the time. You can tell the different DJs by 
                their sets. Those sets are divided by slow songs. Parties have 
                always been a meeting place for guys and girls. If you do not 
                break it down sometimes, they cannot get together. And each set 
                gets faster, to the end of the night when all the hot records 
                are played. The guys leave with the girls and come back next week. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In Europe, the parties tend to have a special theme - like Hellraiser 
                III or similar titles. You would not expect to hear Pierre play 
                there, do you? It stays much more interesting when you do not 
                know what to expect. <br>
                <br>
                <b>BL::</b> What is a good techno record? <br>
                <br>
                <b>JM::</b> On a good record you should hear that the producer 
                is reaching for something - and you can always hear if he is not. 
                I don't even call those techno. The problem is not the music itself 
                - it is the person who calls it techno. I assume that these people 
                like what they do and are happy with it - so it is OK for them. 
                If you want to listen to it - buy the record and go home, but 
                I won't play it. <br>
                <br>
                My thinking is a bit different - the whole art form of techno 
                is in the same vein as technology - reaching for something new. 
                Everytime you make a record. It is not even about the cosmetics 
                of a track, like BPMs or sounds. It can be a sound you hear everyday, 
                like the 909. It's about what the producer does with it. That's 
                why I did the "Cycle 30" (Axis 008). It was not exactly a dance 
                record, more like a message to the young producers, to let them 
                know there is still a lot of things you can do making records. 
                You do not have to buy analog equipment. "Cycle 30" is all digital. 
                Not a single analog sound on it. Why pay up to 2000 Marks for 
                a 303, when you can do without it. You can go back to 86 and buy 
                a 303 record, play it on 45 and you have exactly the same stuff 
                that comes out today. <br>
                <br>
                I did the loops to explain that a track has no beginning and no 
                end. It also changes your thinking as a DJ. The record is not 
                building up - you have to build it into your mix. It takes more 
                skills to play it. It can be you who has a brilliant idea. When 
                people start to produce records because they know a certain crowd 
                will like it, it defeats the purpose. It is no longer an art form. 
                <br>
                <br>
                If I put a sample everybody knows in a track and play it, and 
                the people instantly start to scream and like it, I won't release 
                it. The trick is out the bag. The record is played out after the 
                first time. <br>
                <br>
                There are tracks I made and this happened when I played them - 
                they were never released. That is why I have so many acetates. 
                Most of them I will not release. I missed something on each of 
                them. A good track does not play out. The more you play it, the 
                more you get into it. That is the basis of all the Axis stuff. 
                A record must be ahead of the situation. I also won't say 'Hopefully 
                I will never make a hit'. Maybe in 2 years somebody will go back 
                and listen to Axis 08 and 09 and say...'Damn, this is the shit.' 
                <br>
                <br>
                It is just not my thing to produce a sure hit record. Too many 
                people are doing it at the moment. <br>
                <br>
                And I see what people are not doing, what is missing. When I am 
                back home, I fill in the gap. Take the Axis stuff. It is not House, 
                not really techno, not experimental, it is in-between stuff, grey-area 
                material. Shit people can dance to. <br>
                <br>
                Before we do a track, we go through our crates and look for the 
                stuff we cannot buy but we would like to play. Like Axis 09. I 
                said 'Damn, I wish I had a track that was fast and dark'- So I 
                did one. <br>
                <br>
                A lot of thought goes into the tracks. If you put the whole aspect 
                of making money away, and therefore insert the idea that each 
                track has to make a statement, has to mean something, that the 
                track has to sound like the title reads - then you quickly lose 
                the interest in making money out of it. <br>
                <br>
                Maybe some kid listens to what we do and goes on from that. I 
                cannot imagine what Techno will sound like in 5 years, and this 
                is good. It really bothers me when people stop reaching. <br>
                <br>
                As long as people keep reaching, everything will be fine.</font>
