                were like watersheds...or turning points or something like that.

                <br>
                d-for those in the know that's true. But for the average...and 
                I mean "for those in the know" I'm talking like, a very small 
                amount of people. Even big-name people you might think that'd 
                be in the know aren't in the know. People don't understand that. 
                <br>

                <i>e-we came upon this realization purely by the way they sounded.

                like that, it's like us making the manual...you get wot I'm sayin? 
                And then everybody else reads it, and makes their crap from it.<br>

                d-no. Cuz I know I was the first. So that's that. (laughs, talks

                d-no, no...as long as some people understand, that's all, know 
                wot I mean? Ain't gonna beat your head in on concrete trying to 
                show people what really is...and you can't tell people what's 
                good and what ain't good. It's meant to be a matter of taste, 
                but I know what I know, and certain people out there know what 
                they know, and that's it.<br>

                <i>e-would you say there's a watershed this year (1994) that we

                <br>
                d-there's one thing that Goldie's done that's something different 
                again. And then there's us using live instruments and shit.<br>
                <br>
                <i>e-how about anything that's come out already this year? Like 
                a high point...like the album ("Parallel Universe")... </i><br>
                <br>
                d-that could be, because we use a lot of live instruments on that, 
                so I'm talking about that, yeah. <br>
                <br>
                <i>e-what songs use live instruments on that? </i><br>
                <br>
                d-"Sunspots" and "Universal Love."<br>

                <i>e-well that's obvious...heh, the saxophone. Along those lines, 
                where do you think Reinforced is going in the future? Same direction?</i><br>
                <br>
                d-I dunno. We'll always do things to satisfy the, you know...the 
                masses out there, you get wot I'm saying? If you hear the [first] 
                Cold Mission, we got us using some live trumpet player and all 
                that shit, and playing keyboards and live and all that shit, right?<br>
                <br>
                <i>e-so it's coming full circle--</i><br>
                <br>
                d-on the other side you got all the normal run-of-the-mill stuff 
                as well.<br>
                <br>
                <i>e-so you're pretty much improvising...as you go along.</i><br>
                <br>
                d-yeah yeah.<br>
                <br>
                <i>e-so the crowd is important to you, then? The "masses."</i><br>
                <br>
                d-yeah, we gotta sell the records still, ain't we? Still a business. 
                It's not like I'm sitting down on some big deal and we can get 
                all artsy-fartsy about it...if I could do that, then bloody hell 
                yes...there'd be a lot of things I want to do still, but such 
                is. Still got to sell records. You do something really different 
                and shit, the attitude of a lot of people, they ain't got no open 
                mind. They're like, "Urowww, I don't understand what's going on." 
                Know wot I mean?<br>
                <br>
                <i>e-yeah.</i><br>
                <br>
                d-if it ain't...I dunno, I can't explain. Them people just don't...<br>
                <br>
                <i>e-my town (Columbus, Ohio) is still stuck still stuck in guitar/drum/bass

                d-wot? Drum &#38; bass? <br>
                <br>
                <i>e-no, REAL drum &#38; bass. (laughs) Guitar crap bands.</i><br>

                <br>
                <i>e-yeah...and hip-hop. They can't even accept electronic music 
                whatsoever.</i><br>
                <br>
                d-yeah? Well, such is. Like Wink said, "Open Your Miiiind." (laughs) 
                "Take people on a journey." <br>
                <br>
                <i>e-he he he.</i><br>
                <br>
                d-no, but it's true, tho...know wot I mean? People should open 
                their minds. The way people will hear a record and say "uuuuuwww" 
                coz it ain't up to the normal formula, it's just slightly different: 
                "Uwww, I don't want to know." Oh yeah--see them 4 Hero remixes...you 
                know the house remixes and all of that? <br>
                <br>
                <i>e-yeah...</i><br>
                <br>
                d-they never came out, you know that. We didn't release them [in 
                the UK]. Why? Because people are like, "Why dey doin' house? Uuuow, 
                I don't like house." <br>
                <br>
                <i>e-ha ha ha ha...</i><br>
                <br>
                d-d'you understand? When I did them Tek-9 hip-hop tracks, right? 
                Sometimes it's a waste of time, I dunno why I bother. I do 'em 
                for myself, know wot I mean? "Why'd he put hip-hop on there?" 
                Cuz they just listen to "hardcore," goin' 160 bpm's, night and 
                day. <br>
                <br>
                <i>e-ha ha ha!</i><br>
                <br>
                d-they're just fuckin'...dumbos, you understand?<br>
                <br>
                <i>e-so you got a bad reaction when you had that "Points Proven" 
                stuff...</i><br>
                <br>
                d-when I do the things with the hip-hop on there, and you do things 
                like house mixes, which we've been doing from a long time ago, 
                you get a bad reaction! Or you get people saying, "Oh, they think 
                they can make house." You get some guy who reviews records saying 
                "Oh, now they're jumping on the bandwagon," when from _Rivet 1205_ 
                we had a house bloody track on it...so how can we be jumping on 
                the bandwagon when in 1990 we had a house cut...had a house _label_ 
                out since then as well.<br>
                <br>
                <i>e-oh yeah? What was the name of that?</i><br>
                <br>

                <br>
                d-but you know wot I mean? That's what I'm saying. We just do 
                them fings to say "We were the first, we done that, yeah right 
                right." And we'll just move on. But someone else does that kind 
                of thing and they go "yeah yeah yeah," coz they expect it of Reinforced. 
                Like say someone does the same thing that's like you done, they 
                don't expect that person to be that good or whatever, they go 
                bloody mad about it. Serious, man.<br>
                <br>
                <i>e-yeah i think variety is necessary. Like you say, if you're 
                just somebody who sits and listens to hardcore (drum'n'bass) day

                <br>

                <br>
                <i>e-Danny Breaks said something along the lines that when "Smart-e's" 
                came out and all that crap, people in the mainstream and non-hardcore 
                heads basically rejected hardcore...which was good because only 
                the people who cared stuck around...is that true?</i><br>
                <br>
                d-yeah but I don't think much of the people that "care"...who 
                stuck around. Arright, just because it's "underground" don't mean 
                hardcore ain't got a pop scene still. And i'm not even talking 
                nuttin' like "Smart-E's" and stuff...we've had our piano tracks 
                as well...that crossed over. We've all done that...drum &#38; 
                bass, everybody, we've all had our big tracks that were big poppy 
                kind of crossovers. I'm talking about now, still in the underground. 
                There's still a pop kind of thing. There's certain things that 
                will appeal more than others. Like, you put a reggae hook in it, 
                an shit, people jump up and down like they've gone bonkers! That 
                pop mentality is still there...it's not like the techno scene.

                That's why I like about the techno scene when I come here (the

                d-but musically, i'm not thinking about them "Nigerian beats" 
                I heard last week or nothin'...<br>

                so did you hear any of those before you started doing hardcore?</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                <br>
                d-I heard some all the time...<br>
                <br>
                <i>e-do you think that kinda made your sense of rhythm...uh, come 
                out more, or just made you more aware of something?</i><br>
                <br>
                d-dunno, man...(laughs)...you're a bit too deep now...<br>
                <br>
                <i>e-(laughs) well, everything's connected. That's how I see it...</i><br>
                <br>
                d-yeah yeah, that's true. Basically, only thing you could say 
                is: yeah, the way you talk about Africa, yeah I know, that's where 
                we were originally from and all that shit, but the way I live 
                stems from Jamaica, you know wot I mean? Then you get all those 
                who chat about Marcus Garvey and all that, about Africa and all 
                that...but...it's not really at the forefront of my mind, speaking 
                musically and shit.</font></font></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
