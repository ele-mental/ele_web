            PREFACE:<br>
            Dego McFarlane is best known as an original member of 4 Hero, founder 
            of the <a href="http://www.reinforcedrecords.co.uk/">Reinforced Records</a> 
            label, and a primary force behind the form of music we now know as 
            <b>drum'n'bass</b>. His numerous projects include work as 4 Hero, 
            Tek 9, Jacob's Optical Stairway, Nu Era, Tom &amp; Jerry, and other 
            aliases; often working closely with the other half of 4 Hero, Mark 
            Mac. <br>
            <br>
            This conversation took place on the phone while Dego was at Josh Wink's 
            studio in Philadelphia. They were working on the material for a techno 
            release on Ovum Records.<br>
            <br>
            Pleas note that this was my very first interview, and should be read 
            as an amateur, if honest, attempt to penetrate the pioneering musical 
            world of Reinforced Records.</font><font size="1"><br>

                  do somethin' to people sometimes when they hear them on drugs,

                  d-some certain things you hear that just impact like "Fuckin..." 
                  you know you're there...it was literally like "Fuckin' 'ell, 
                  man!" Some of that early stuff, man...like the first time I 
                  ever heard "Planet Rock" an' shit, you know? And "Knights of 
                  the Round Turntable" and fings like that...first time you hear 
                  things like that it's like SHIT! <br>

                  <i>e-so that was a big influence...</i> <br>
                  <br>
                  d-we used to live with all that shit in the 80s, yea. That was 
                  the "boom" as they say. <br>
                  <br>
                  <i>e-so when did you start getting into it, pretty much when

                  d-I liked listening to it, an' shit...and popping and all of 
                  that crap to it...weren't thinkin' of no records of nothin' 
                  at that time. Didn't think of makin' records for a long long 
                  time after that. Years and years. <br>

                  <i>e-it takes a while to sink in, huh?</i> <br>

                  d-in fact, I got into that accidentally anyways. I never thought 
                  I'd be makin' a record ever. <br>

                  <i>e-Hm. Is electro essentially dead?</i> <br>
                  <br>
                  d-I dunno, maybe electro's is what you call techno now. Like 
                  how techno's 909-based, kinda, and electro was 808, but I dunno, 
                  maybe techno's taken over. The electro's in there, in techno 
                  I reckon. Or you could say electro could be Miami as well, but...I'm 
                  not so sure about that Miami Bass shit. <br>
                  <br>

                  <br>
                  <i>e-well, see I would almost go further than that and say that 
                  hardcore is the logical descendant of electro. There's a lot 
                  of connection. Cuz it's not like hip hop, but it uses hip hop 
                  type of aesthetic, same as electro did.</i> <br>

                  d-electro and hip hop? electro was played an' shit, innit? Wasn't 
                  all this sampling kinda stuff. Um, it's a bit more experimental, 
                  it's different, you know? They used the maddest sounds and all 
                  of that, so... <br>
                  <br>
                  <i>e-because back then they were pretty much the same-</i>- 
                  <br>

                  d-yea yea, it was the same fing, back them days, but now...

                  <br>
                  d-they split off...I dunno when they split off, maybe when samplers 
                  came in they broke off. I dunno. It's very hard to say. <br>
                  <br>
                  <i>e-I understand there are different kinds of clubs for blacks 
                  and for whites...you don't go out much, but--</i> <br>
                  <br>
                  d-I mean, it's still mixed, but nowadays, like in the last year 
                  or so, you can say that more of the reggae crowd's come in an' 
                  shit. So you will get clubs where there's more black people 
                  there and you will get clubs with the happier side of things 
                  where there's more whites and stuff, but it's still fairly mixed 
                  from what I can see--I can't really talk on the scene...cuz 
                  I'm just never there. <br>

                  d-uh, yeah...it is inspiration...I like the way they went about 
                  everything, doin' it themselves. There's a lot of things I can 
                  draw the same lines how we started up...delivering records around 
                  ourselves and all that shit. We didn't have a distribution deal 
                  first...and that's the same that happened with all them guys 
                  out there...what they used to do, and how they fought the majors' 
                  attitudes and all that shit. Innovative...a lot of the things

                  d-oh no, it's fairly easy, to tell you the truth. To hear it 
                  is easy, but to get them is another thing, cuz once it comes 
                  in the shop you best be there the day it came in cuz it's gone.
