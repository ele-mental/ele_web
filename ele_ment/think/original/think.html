      ...do we have a better word? well, 'electronic dance music' is quite a mouthful...and 
      there's a lot of techno and electronic music that isn't really intended 
      for dancing (like ambient music, for example... which isn't very 'danceable' 
      unless you pretend you are floating in space or something). whatever we 
      choose to call it, it's 'our' music, and it's the reason most of us are 
      involved in the scene, directly or indirectly.<br>
      <br>
      but what do we really <i>know</i> about techno? we might know that there 
      are certain kinds of techno that we like, whether it be house, breakbeat, 
      drum'n'bass, trance, gabber, electro, ambient, trip-hop, or whatever&#133; 
      but do we really know (or care) where these styles of music came from or 
      how they developed? <br>
      <br>
      and why do we even like techno at all? is it the repetitive, trance-inducing 
      beat? is it the cool electronic effects? is it the lure of the substances 
      that some of us choose to use? is it simply because it's the 'cool' thing 
      to do now -- a simple cultural code like the fashion, dances, attitudes, 
      or rituals of <i>any</i> subculture? what makes techno (and therefore raves/house 
      parties/events/etc.) so special, if anything at all? <br>
      <br>
      this article is not intended to answer all of these questions. of course 
      there's no room for that! but hopefully you will find some things in here 
      that will stimulate you to make a few conclusions, and maybe find some new 
      connections of your own. there's a lot to know about techno, and even more 
      to say (trust me).<br>
      <br>
      well, first off, it must be said that techno is not just 'mindlessly repetitive 
      dance music' made automatically by computers. nor is it just 'kiddie' music, 
      made to listen to while sporting really big clothes. nor is techno the 'bastard 
      child' of rock 'n' roll. techno music, in fact, has a long history that 
      stretches back much further than you might 'think'... </font><br>

      and SPACE's keyboard-driven disco anthems); disco itself (it was the first

      LEE PERRY's pioneering studio experimentation); and the electronic doodlings

      but the roots of techno go much deeper; into areas outside of music altogether&#133;to 
      issues of race (believe me, it DOES matter), gender (why aren't more women 
      really involved in the scene?), economics (capitalism, commercialization, 
      and the economic marginalization of entire cultures -- which, ironically, 
      is often the catalyst for new musical forms), technology (<i>somebody</i> 
      had to design all those keyboards and gadgets), movement, images, mathematics, 
      space travel, psychedelics, academics (and the politics of today's 'classical 
      music' which favors formula and stagnation over innovation and experimentation), 
      anthropology, sociology, psychology, human ingenuity, and so on&#133;a complex 
      web of concerns, attitudes, ideologies, cultures, and experiences. these 
      things are all essential towards a deeper understanding of techno (and all 
      music!)&#133;but for simplicity's sake, let's get back to the music: to 
      the music cultures, inventions, and people who brought us here...<br>

      'house' got its name); the mid '70s-early '80s breakdance/hip-hop scene

      music), the '70s 'discotheque' and the beginnings of club culture (in the 
      lounged-out '50s-'60s); the 'sound-systems' of '50s-'60s jamaica ('proto-raves'

      I," for percussion & microphone noise) were among the first to exploit the
