<i><b>brendan gillen</b> wrote to remind me of some omissions.  he wrote this before the entire piece was up, so some (like THEREMIN) were ones he didn't know i had included.  and again, i never claimed the piece to be compehensive.  it had to fit in a very small amount of space!<br><br></i>

Well I think its a good thing you've done. I hope you introduce alot of
people to some good music and ideas.
<br><br>
But it seems you were out to prove techno was white.

Like disco had nothing to do with techno.  On non synth funk.  That was
weird.  Or was that just a history of synthesis?

I think some glaring exclusions include:

Raymond Scott (who Moog ripped off for his first synth designs)
Don Buchla (inventor / electronic composer)
Theremin and whoever did the soundtrack to Forbidden Planet
Joe Meek

Disco.  Georgio Moroder did his classic "I Feel Love" in 1977, same year as
"Trans Europe-Express"!  To Detroiters new wave like New Order, Liasons
Dangueruse and weird synth-disco like Martin Circus' "Disco Circus" were the shit.

Dub.  King Tubby, Lee Perry changed the compositional process and
opportunities.  The Echoplex!

YMO
Yello
Silver Apples (1968 with hand-played oscillators!) <br><i>(ed note: "silver apples" was composed and performed by MORTON SUBOTNIK)</i>
Can, Neu, Cluster, Popul Vuh and many other great german trance/space
rock.  Where did ENOs ambient come from if not Cluster?

And A Number of Names <i>(ed note: A NUMBER OF NAMES produced "shari vari")</i> predate Juan.  
And his first single is a rip of "X Man" by Ultravox! ("Alleys of Your Mind).  
And "Planet Rock" is from 1981 <i>(ed note: 1982)</i> and predates Juan also.  
And the version of Clear that is famous is a REMIX by "Animal" Diaz from 1983.  
It is quite different from the orginal LP mix on 1982's Enter.

Anyway, just some ideas.

Uh huh. A worthy effort! I applaud you!
Better check those dates as far as "predating Juan" goes.
I should check them before writing :) but if you believe
the Detroit Free Press Magazine article of Feb. 4, 1990:

     "Davis was a Vietnam Veteran with world experience under his belt,
     Atkins an eager apprentice. The two became Cybotron and recorded
     their first hit, a funky, dance tune called 'Cosmic Car,' in the
     late '70s on their own label, Deep Space Records.'

One of these days, someone has to sit down with Juan, Derrick, and Kevin
and nail down all their early influences. Get the timeline straight.

I think Cybotron's "Alleys of your mind" sold 15,000 copies in '81,
and owes a debt to Ultravox's "Mr. X" of 1980. Which in turn owes
a debt to Kraftwerk's "Hall of Mirrors" from the album Trans Europe Express.

Another infulence of Detroit Techno is Gary Numan, and his song "Cars" ('79?)

An interesting note: since the '60s, the "Detroit Sound" has been
compared to a relentless driving assembly-line sound. A main
characteristic of early Motown was it's lack of a bridge--the music
doesn't stop.

Back to techno in general:
You really can't say enough about Kraftwerk, whose 1974 album "Autobahn"
influenced techno, hip hop, new wave, techno-pop, progressive rock, and
most of the second side sounds pretty ambient. :)

If I had to pick the oldest record that sounds like the newest techno, it
would have to be "The Wozard of Iz" by Bernard Krause, circa 1970, which
has several bars of modular moog riffing that could be taken for 808 State.

While more industrial than techno, George Antheil certainly deserves
a mention as a mid-20th century composer. And the original Art of Noises
came from Italian Futurist Marinetti in the early 20th cen. For that matter,
where's the influence of film, literature, Art, the 1939 world's fair, and the
industrial age itself? Techno didn't occur in a vaccuum. :)

BTW, the word "techno" was first used in the 1800s, according to the OED.

Apart from this, check the alt.rave FAQ (it's on hyperreal.com)

<i>and a self-correction from eric:</i>
<blockquote><pre>Ed,

WRT my previous comments...

I mentioned Marinetti in conjunction with the "Art of Noises"
which is wrong. I got my Italian Futurists mixed up :)
Russolo is the painter/composer who pretty much invented
industrial music.
