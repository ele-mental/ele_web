<i>this article documents an ongoing and personal journey to understand and reveal the origins of electronic/experimental music and ideas.  the project began with a pamphlet entitled "THINK" in august of 1995, and has been updated, corrected, and revised numerous times since; as a pamphlet, web document, and article appearing in MASSIVE 12 in early 1996.  a second pamphlet entitled "THINK(again)" appeared in march 1997.  this new version entitled "THINK(about it)" has been re-written from december 1997 to march 1998, and will be continually updated and revised as it becomes an online entity.</i><br><br><hr><br>

<font size=4><b>electronic sounds</b></font>...they're all around us.  the bleeps and bloops of technology have now become such a part of our daily lives that we probably don't even notice them.  but there are some electronic sounds that deserve to be listened to more closely; sounds that have been sculpted into shape by a fusion between cold technology and warm human spirit.  you've probably already noticed the abstract sound effects or immersive soundtracks of video games, television, movies, or other imaginary realities; the throbbing tones tumbling out of radio speakers, stereos, and personal walkmans; the tinny, repetitive twitters echoing through the caverns of shopping malls; or the raspy bitstreams downloaded from the internet.  no matter where we encounter them, this loose, diverse grouping of familiar and unfamiliar forms is changing the way we define, understand, and experience music.<br><br>

if you're reading this, you've probably already stumbled into this deeper current...through a friend, in a magazine, on the radio, on the net, or at your local record store, clothing store, club, or underground party­whether you're just an occasional listener, net surfer, armchair appreciator, casual club-goer, dancer, or hardcore raver.  no matter what angle you approach it from, no matter what kind of music has formed you, there's probably something here that will make sense to you within the infinite folds of this music.<br><br>

but what do we call it?  is it 'electronica,' 'techno,' 'house,' or what?  and what do we really know about this music?  do we really know where the many styles (including techno, house, drum'n'bass, trip-hop, hardcore, ambient, noise, etc.) came from or how they developed?  do we even understand why we like this music at all?  is it the repetitive, trancelike beats?  is it the tweaked-out electronic sounds?  is it the lure of mind-altering substances that are often associated with the electronic music experience?  is it simply because it's the 'cool' thing to do now­a simple cultural code like the fashion, dances, attitudes, or rituals of any culture or subculture? what makes electronic dance music and its scenes (including raves/house parties/events/concerts/weeklies etc.) so special, if anything at all?<br><br>

this article is not intended to answer all of these questions (there's no room for that!).  
instead, it can only throw you a lot of facts, names, and ideas, in the hope of encouraging you to make a few conclusions and connections of your own (don't be intimidated, check the end of this article for some pointers on how to hear some of this music and read more about its origins).  <br><br>

we'll begin by describing the very broad categories of electronic dance (and dance-related) music, and then try to sort out the problems of finding a general name to describe it all.  we'll break down some of the biggest misconceptions about this music, placing it firmly within its own unique context, before checking off many of the most important moments of recent electronic dance music history.  then we¹ll venture back into more general electronic and pop music movements, and delve ever deeper to older or parallel threads, cultures, ideas, movements, inventions, and people (within the electronic and experimental tradition, or without) who have brought us here.  we'll end by giving props to some of the present-day movements, composers, and record labels who are pushing into new areas or re-exploring old ones in new ways.  as you'll see, there's a lot to say about this music, and even more to know...covering a lot more territory than you might 'think'...
<br><br>

even if you've only been paying the most casual attention to this music and its many categories, you could probably say a lot about it.  if you've heard the slinky minimalism of PLASITKMAN (RICHIE HAWTIN), the expansive undulations of UNDERWORLD, or the sniveling dance/trance of ORBITAL, then you already know something about techno.  if you've heard the easy swing of DAFT PUNK, the tasty tweaks of JOSH WINK, or the disco thumps of ARMAND VAN HELDEN, then you know something about house.  if you've heard the jazzy two-steps of RONI SIZE, the rumbling drum tantrums of GOLDIE, or the ruptured percussive patterns of PHOTEK, then you know drum'n'bass.  if you've absorbed the dubbed-out dabblings of THE ORB, or the abstract meanderings of FUTURE SOUND OF LONDON, you know ambient.  you may even know about more specific categories such as 'acid house,' 'funky breaks,' 'electro,' 'illbient,' and others.  and if you've heard music by APHEX TWIN, BJÖRK, THE CHEMICAL BROTHERS, THE PRODIGY, BECK, U2, and DEPECHE MODE, then you already know how this music can merge with pop. rock, hip-hop, and other, more familiar musical styles; blurring the broadest of categories together to create new, undefined forms.  but the artists we've just mentioned only represent the most commercially-successful creases within the intricate fabric of dance, electronic, and experimental music, and their mainstream popularity often hides (or even misrepresents) the musical cultures that gave them birth.  of course, it's more complicated than that, but to begin to understand what's behind all of this, let's sketch the broadest categories of present-day electronic music (in CAPS), as well as more specific strains (in 'quotes'), and a whole lot of other concepts along the way...<br><br>

TECHNO is a technologically-minded music whose basic codes were first laid out in the post-punk machine music of european 'new wave' and 'techno pop,' with origins in the UK, germany, and belgium.  but it was in the post-industrial ruins of detroit, michigan (the 'motor city') where technology, funk, and history came together in the late '80s to forge the techno prototype that took the world by storm, even as older or parallel european forms stamped their own unique molds along the way.  this mechanized music for 'the age of information' celebrates its technological origin in computers, synthesizers, and electronic gadgetry; and in its purest forms, techno often relies on robotic sounds and driving, 4/4 beats (with some off-beat syncopation) ranging in speed from about 120-150 beats per minute.  but in spite of the mechanisms that make techno music what it is, the human elements of funk, improvisation, and innovation are still the foundation of techno's musical architecture, and underlie everything from the aggressive metallic clangs of 'hard techno,' to the rubbery, contorted bleeps and bloops of 'minimal techno,' the smooth, futuristic landscapes of 'intelligent' techno, the warmer atmospheres of much detroit techno, and a wide variety of introspective, funky, jazzy, complex, and melodic techno from all over the world.  with strongholds in cities and countries as diverse as detroit, minneapolis, new york, berlin, frankfurt, munich, vienna, edinburgh, london, sweden, finland, singapore, and japan, techno has also proven itself to be a versatile worldwide musical template...transcending the barriers of language, race, gender, politics, and musical categorization with its simple, unspoken sonic message.<br><br>

HOUSE is an electronic evolution of late ¹70s disco and funk, originating in new york clubs and perfected in chicago by the early '80s, becoming a mainstream phenomenon in england and europe by the late '80s, and seeping back into mainstream american culture soon thereafter.  house proudly carries on the traditions of the disco/funk/soul/blues/gospel family tree, replete with the sorrows and triumphs of african-american history, whose own roots reach back to rhythms and soul of african music.  house is at once sophisticated, simple-minded, technical, clumsy, subtle, and outlandish.  it is unified by the skip-to, disco-style beat (with the high hat on the 'ands': one-AND-two-AND-three), with speeds ranging from about 120-150 bpm.  its many branches have spread worldwide and include chicago's own styles such as the sample-based soul nostalgia of Œdisco house¹; the southside phenomenon of dirty, porno house called 'ghetto house' (aka 'booty house'); the basic, hard-headed tracks known simply as 'trax' (or 'hard house'); and the original 'acid house,' whose tweaky basslines and sparse, echoey beats were also the soundtrack for the UK's earliest rave scenes.  other house movements include new york's disco-diva 'garage house' and stylish 'club house' of various persuasions, detroit's deep, jazzy, 'underground house,' england's own disco-style 'handbag house,' progressive-style 'UK house,'  and the older 'ambient house,' the aptly-named 'hi-NRG' of urban gay scenes, italy's flashy 'italo house,' various kinds of hispanic-tinged 'latin house,' other kinds of melodic, crowd-moving 'progressive house,' and the mainstream sounds of 'pop house.'  in its open-armed diversity, house continues to bring many dance cultures together under the same roof, with its uplifting grooves that celebrate the strength and vitality of today's house nation.<br><br>

there's music built with sampled 'breakbeats,' a tradition begun by new york's hip-hop DJs in the mid '70s, who would often discover a short drum break in an obscure soul or funk record, and play that one snippet over and over to audience acclaim.  today, breakbeats are taken from those same old records as well as live drummers, and are then digitally-rearranged in a wide variety of ways.  the london-born category known as DRUM'N'BASS (recently known in america primarily as JUNGLE) speeds these beats up into the 150-170 bpm area, cuts them into many pieces, emphasizes the off-beats (syncopation), and recombines them into new structures.  drum'n'bass was born from raves, reggae, and experimental breakbeat/hip-hop; with variations including the dark, repetitive sturm-and-clang of 'techstep,' the experimental, jazz-minded doodlings sometimes called 'fungle,' the hip-hop posturings of 'jump-up' (aka 'hardstep'), the smooth, simple dreaminess of 'intelligent,' and older styles such as the west indian/reggae-inspired 'ragga,' experimental-style 'hardcore' (ca. 1992-94), the seething shadows of 'darkside' (ca. 1992-94), and the original cut-and-paste sample collages known as BREAKBEAT (ca. 1988-92), which took a different turn in the US and became the slower, funked-up bump'n'grind loosely known as 'funky breaks' or 'slow breaks,' connected to the hippy-infused sensibilities of san francisco and the colorful party cultures of miami, with speeds usually around 120-140 bpm.  the hip-hop inspired offshoot which has unwillingly been dubbed TRIP-HOP (variously known as ACID JAZZ or 'downtempo') slows the beats down to peanut-butter speeds, and was cued by a renewed british interest in old, obscure american and afro-cuban soul/funk records (also called 'rare groove') in the late '80s.  trip-hop evokes the soulful moods of these releases, while taking the hip-hop formula into more abstract, jazz-inspired areas by subduing the vocal element in favor of thick, slow-motion atmosphere.
