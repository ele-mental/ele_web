When Cybotron recorded 'Techno City', black music was in the Electro
age officially ushered in by Afrika Bambaataa's 'Planet Rock' and
Arthur Baker's take on Krafwerk's 'Numbers'. Cybotron were right in
there: Juan Atkins and Rick Davies (aka 3070) had recorded 'Alleys Of
Your Mind', a prime piece of future shock, in 1981, but they were
stuck in Detroit. Nobody knew about them: "I had to pay some pretty
terrible dues to make the music," says Davies today; "You're almost
invisible in time and space if you're doing something new".<br><br>

In late 1984, 'Techno city' was released in the UK on the fourth
Streetsounds' "Electro" compilation. For many, including myself, it
was the standout cut: Electro in its beats and some of the percussion
(those handclaps!), but there was something else. The vocals were cool
but highly passionate; the sounds were caressing, spacious and highly
synthetic. It was, and remains, both exciting and scary, precisely
balanced between utopia and dystopia, between the future as dream and
the future as nightmare.<br><br>

"The techno Rebels are, whether they recognise it or not, agents of
the Third Wave. They will not vanish but multiply in the years ahead.
For they are as much part of the advance to a new stage of
civilisation as our missions to Venus, our amazing computers, our
biological discoveries, or our explorations of the oceanic depths."
Alvin Toffler: "The Third Wave" (1980).
<br><br>
"Music is prophecy: its styles and economic organisation are ahead of
the rest of society because it explores, much faster than material
reality can, the entire range of possibilities in a given code. It
makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."
Jacques Attali: "Noise" (1977)
<br><br>
Nearly ten years later, we're all living in Techno City. Techno has
become the international dance language: a catch-all phrase that can
mean anything from Euro-Pop - Two Unlimited's 'No Limit' with its
classic "techno techno techno" rap - to the speed driven mania of
'Ardkore, or the lush travelogues currently marketed as Ambient. If
there is one central idea to Techno, it's of harmony between man and
machine: as Juan Atkins says, "Techno is technological. It's an
attitude to making music that sounds futuristic: something that
hasn't been done before".
<br><br>
Atkins was in at the ground level of Techno, being featured, along
with Kevin Saunders and Derrick May, on the 1988 UK compilation that
put the term on the map: Virgin's "Techno! The New Dance School of
Detroit". This trinity have since become internationally respected
and successful DJ's, producers and performers, but that wasn't the
start of it: as Jimmy Castor says, "what we're going to do here is go
right back, way back, back into time".
<br><br>
It's 1980. There is no American Electro. There is black futurism but
it's Funk: Earth Wind and Fire, the Parliafunkadelicment thang. A DJ
called Electrifyin' Mojo is, however, playing these weird records on
Detroit radio: cuts by the Human League, Ultravox, Kraftwerk's
'Trans-Europe Express' (a minor disco hit in the US), Gary Numan's
'Cars'. Two young black men meet at Washtenaw Community College in
Michigan, both fired by the example of local hero George Clinton and
these extraterrestrial moises beamed in on the ether.
<br><br>
"It was destiny for us to meet up", Juan Atkins says. "We liked a lot
of the same things - books, films. Science fiction: you gotta be into
SF stuff to like that kind of electronic music. When I heard digital
music, I thought you had to be a computer programmer to make those
records. I found out it wasn't as complicated as I'd thought: Rick
had one of the first Roland sequencers and we made 'Alleys Of Your
Mind' by ourselves."
<br><br>
A Detroit native, Rick Davies had been shipped out to Vietnam just in
time for the January 1968 Tet offensive. He doesn't want to talk about
it: "I guess I'm not to get into street education. The streets are
pretty bad." After, he went to electronic school and started playing
early synthesiser equipment like the Arp Axe and the Arp Odyssey: one
result was "an experimental record called 'The Methane Sea': it was a
multitrack recording. The Electrifyin' Mojo used it as the opening
monologue to his show."
<br><br>
Together with Atkins, Davies came up with the concept for Cybotron:
"I'd got into Alvin Toffler and his comments concerning the
electronic village. I considered that there had to be more than three
waves and extrapolated the necessity of interfacing the spirituality
of human beings into the cybernetic matrix: between the brain, the
soul and the mechanisms of cyberspace."
<br><br>
As part of this concept, he also changed his name to 3070: "I was
doing the Zoharian discipline at the time: to be in cyberspace, it
was necessary for me to find an interface where I could find my
deepest inner being. Zohar is based on the study of numbers: to
become an entity you have to become a non-entity, and 3070 was my
Zoharian designation. I had dues to pay to the Cosmic Lord: that's
why I had to do 'Megiddo' and 'Eden'."
<br><br>
Atkins helped to develop the concepts and provided the Funk, but it
was a new kind of Funk: stripped, cool. "Nothing was really
deliberate," he says. "Everything was on feel. My music has always
been very minimal. If it's there, it's there. If it's doing the job,
why dress it up any more? We used Rolands, Arps, the Korg MS 20. The
whole idea was to do something futuristic, that hadn't been done
before."
<br><br>
'Alleys Of Your Mind' was recorded in a friend's 4-track home studio.
Released independently on Deep Space, it sold about 15,000 copies and
went to #1 in the local radio charts, until, as Davies tells it,
"major label promo people made the radio stations stop playing the
record." Cybotron signed to Fantasy to get more clout, added an
occasional guitarist, John Howesley, and made the "Enter",
subsequently "Clear" album - from which the bulk of the cuts here are
taken.
<br><br>
This was Cybotron's purple patch, building from Kraftwerk's
electronic grid and the alienation of UK Electro to redraw the map of
their blasted city. "You can look at the state of Detroit as a plus,"
says Atkins. "Alright, you only take 15 minutes to get from one side
of the city centre to the other, and the main department store is
boarded up, but we're at the forefront here. When the new technology
came in, Detroit collapsed as an industrial city, but Detroit is
Techno City: it's getting better, it's coming back around."
<br><br>
"'Techno City' was the electronic village," says Davies. "It was
divided into different sectors. I'd watched Fritz Lang's "Metropolis"
- which had the privileged sector in the clouds and the underground
worker's city. I thought there should be three sectors: the idea was
that a person could be born and raised in Techno City - the worker's
city - but what he wanted to do was work his way to the cybodrome
where artists and intellectuals reside. There would be no Moloch, but
all sorts of diversions, games, electronic instruments. Techno City
was the equivalent of the ghetto in Detroit: on Woodward Avenue the
pimps, pushers etc get overlooked by the Renaissance Tower."
<br><br>
For Cybotron, electronic music wasn't only an ideal (or even an
escape) but a way of being positive about contemporary urban reality
- a theme which continues in today's Techno. One way of dealing with
it was (and is) high-speed travel. "At the time of 'Cosmic Cars' I
was living in the suburbs," adds Davies. "Juan would have to take
long drives to get together. It was part of the city's nightlife that
you had to interface with car radios - Gary Numan did it with 'Cars'.
it was necessary to interface with that tribe."
<br><br>
Despite their quality, Cyboron made no headway in the climate of the
time. Davies: "The radio stations refused to play these records -
'robo shit', they called it. Gary Numan and Howard Jones started
using real instruments. Kraftwerk made little penetration. The
acoustos conspired together with the Musicians Guilds in the US and
the UK to suppress synthesisers. Anyone into cyberspace and
synthersisers couldn't play. They Cyberlords, being suppressed, had
to practice and await the time when the acoustos would get too far
gone and be shattered."
<br><br>
There was friction between Davies and Atkins: artistic differences
over 'Techno City'. In 1985, Davies left to go to college in Berkeley
and worked on the final Cybotron cuts from there: 'Eden' was
completely solo. Atkins stayed in Detroit and began working on his
Model 500 project, the results of which are mandatory listening and
can be heard on the R&#38;S compilation, "Classics", released this year.
Atkins has also released an album with 3MB this year, while Davies
has a brand new album, "Empathy", forthcoming on Fantasy.
<br><br>
Before they split however, Cybotron produced the track which stands
as their epitaph: the unique, prophetic 'Visions'. Presented by a
'celestial archivist first-class' to 'the celestial university of
inter-dimensional studies', as from the pre-apocalyptic era, circa
1986, 'Visions' presents a hyper-bleak view of industrial wastelands
and burning bodies punctuated with the plea: "I need something to
believe in". The cut resolves in the soft, repeated cry of "trance".
<br><br>
Well, it happened, only two years later. Cybotron were too early to
benfit from the successive waves of transcendent club culture which
thay had influenced. "A lot of it was as we planned," Atkins says
now. "Nobody knew Techno would be the global thing that it is now,
from little Detroit." As our past, present and future start to spin
before our eyes, and our feet start to slip the positivism inherent
in techno (which, according to Davies, reflects "the shamanistic
tendency in late 20th Century man") remains a guide.
