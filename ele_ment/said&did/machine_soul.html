      <i><tt>"The 'soul' of the machines has always been a part of our music. 
      Trance always belongs to repetition, and everybody is looking for trance 
      in life... in sex, in the emotional, in pleasure, in anything... so, the 
      machines produce an absolutely perfect trance."</tt></i><br>

      <p> "It's like a cry for survival," a panicked male voice calls out. The 
        beat pauses, but the dancers do not. Then <a href="http://hyperreal.com/music/artists/orbital/">Orbital</a> 
        throw us back into the maelstrom: into a blasting Terry Riley sample, 
        into the relentless machine rhythm, into a total environment of light 
        and sound. We forget about the fact that we're tired, that the person 
        in front of us is invading our space with his flailing arms. Then, suddenly, 
        we're there: locked into the trance, the higher energy. It does happen, 
        just like everybody always says: along with thousands of others, we lift 
        off. </p>
      <p> The Brixton Academy is a 3500-capacity venue in South London. Built 
        at the turn of the century in the style of a Moorish temple, it may look 
        beautiful but it's hard to enliven: groups as diverse as the Beastie Boys 
        and Pavement have disappeared into its dark, grimy corners. Tonight, however, 
        it is full of white light and movement: the whole stage is a mass of projections, 
        strobes and dry ice, in front of which a raised dance floor has been put 
        in. Above us is stretched white cloth: at the sides of the building, the 
        alcoves are lit up and flanked by projections of pulsating globules. </p>
      <p> The whole scene reminds me of the place I wanted to be when I was 18, 
        the same age as most of this audience: the Avalon Ballroom. Never mind 
        that most of the dancers were born long after the San Francisco scene 
        had passed: they're busy chasing that everlasting present. The sound is 
        techno but psychedelic references abound: in the light shows, the fashions 
        (everything ranging form beatnik to short-hair to late '60s long-hair), 
        the T-shirts that read "Feed Your Head" (that climactic line from Jefferson 
        Airplane's "White Rabbit"), the polydrug use that is going on all around 
        us. </p>
      <p> This event is called Midi Circus: an ambitious attempt by the London 
        promoters <a href="http://www.spidacom.co.uk//megadog.htm">Megadog</a> 
        to make dance music performance work. It's obvious from the lightness 
        of the atmosphere that time and energy have been spent on the staging. 
        The acts selected --the Orb, Orbital, the Aphex Twin-- are the most interesting 
        working in the techno/psych crossover that has moved into areas formerly 
        associated with rock: large public events, raves, festivals. It's here 
        you will find the millenarian subculture of techno primitives, half in 
        electronic noise, half in earth-centered paganism. </p>
      <p> Orbital's name is taken from the M25 Orbital motorway that circles London; 
        it comes from the period, three years ago, when huge raves were held around 
        the capital's outer limits. They've had a couple of hits, and have just 
        released a fine second LP (due out in the U.S. next month). Tonight, they 
        stand behind their synths wearing helmets with two beams roughly where 
        their eyes would be. When the dry ice and the strobes are in full effect, 
        they look like trolls from <i>Star Wars</i>, or, perhaps more unsettling, 
        coal miners. And then, as machine noise swirls around us, it hits me. 
        This is industrial displacement. Now that England has lost most of its 
        heavy industry, its children are simulating an industrial experience for 
        their entertainment and transcendence. </p>

      <tt><i>At first the art of music sought and achieved purity, limpidity and 
      sweetness of sound. Then different sounds were amalgamated, care being taken, 
      however, to caress the ear with gentle harmonies. Today music, as it becomes 
      continually more complicated, strives to amalgamate the most dissonant, 
      strange and harsh sounds. In this way we come ever closer to </i>noise-sound<i>.</i></tt><br>

      <br>
      <p> Techno is everywhere in England this year. Beginning as a term applying 
        to a specific form of dance music --the minimal, electronic cuts that 
        Detroiters like Derrick May, Juan Atkins, and Kevin Saunderson were making 
        in the mid '80s--techno has become a catchall pop buzzword: this year's 
        grunge. When an unabashed Europop record like 2 Unlimited's "No Limit"--think 
        Snap, think Black Box--blithely includes a rap that goes "Techno techno 
        techno techno," you know that you're living within a major pop phenomenon. 
      </p>
      <p> My experience of it has been colored by my recent circumstances: frequent 
        travel, usually by car. Techno is the perfect travelling music, being 
        all about speed: its repetitive rhythms, minimal melodies, and textural 
        modulations are perfect for the constantly shifting perspectives offered 
        by high-speed travel. Alternatively, the fizzing electronic sounds all 
        too accurately reproduce the snap of synapses forced to process a relentless, 
        swelling flood of electronic information. </p>
      <p> If there is one central idea in techno, it is of the harmony between 
        man and machine. As Juan Atkins puts it: "You gotta look at it like, techno 
        is technological. It's an attitude to making music that sounds futuristic: 
        something that hasn't been done before." This idea is commonplace throughout 
        much of avant-garde 20th-century art--early musical examples include Russolo's 
        1913 <i>Art of Noises</i> manifesto and '20s ballets by <a href="http://www.inch.com/~ari/es1.html">Erik 
        Satie</a> ("Rel&acirc;che") and George Antheil ("Ballet m&eacute;chanique"). 
        Many of Russolo's ideas prefigure today's techno in everything but the 
        available hardware, like the use of nonmusical instruments in his 1914 
        composition, <i>Awakening of a City</i>. </p>
      <p> Postwar pop culture is predicated on technology, and its use in mass 
        production and consumption. Today's music technology inevitably favors 
        unlimited mass reproduction, which is one of the reasons why the music 
        industry, using the weapon of copyright, is always fighting a rearguard 
        battle against its free availability. Just think of those "Home Taping 
        Is Killing Music" stickers, the restrictive prices placed on every new 
        Playback/Record facility (the twin tape deck, the DAT), the legal battles 
        between samplers and copyright holders. </p>
      <p> There are obviously ethical considerations here--it's easy to understand 
        James Brown's outrage as his uncredited beats and screams underpin much 
        of today's black music--but at its best, today's new digital, or integrated 
        analog and digital, technology c an encourage a free interplay of ideas, 
        a real exchange of information. Most recording studios in the U.S. and 
        Europe will have a sampler and a rack of CDs: a basic electronic library 
        of Kraftwerk, James Brown, Led Zeppelin--today's Sound Bank. </p>
      <p> Rap is where you first heard it--Grandmaster Flash's 1981 "Wheels of 
        Steel," which scratched together Queen, Blondie, the Sugarhill Gang, the 
        Furious Five, Sequence, and Spoonie Gee--but what is sampling if not digitized 
        scratching? If rap is more an American phenomenon, techno is where it 
        all comes together in Europe as producers and musicians engage in a dialogue 
        of dazzling speed. </p>

      --Kraftwerk: "Techno Pop" (1986)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> <a href="http://www.cs.umu.se/tsdf/KRAFTWERK/">Kraftwerk</a> stand at 
        the bridge between the old, European avant-garde and today's Euro-American 
        pop culture. Like many others of their generation, Florian Schneider and 
        Ralf H&uuml;tter were presented with a blank slate in postwar Germany: 
        as H&uuml;tter explains, "When we started, it was like shock, silence. 
        Where do we stand? Nothing. We had no father figures, no continuous tradition 
        of entertainment. Through the '50s and '60s, everything was Americanized, 
        directed toward consumer behavior. We were part of this 1968 movement, 
        where suddenly there were possibilities, then we started to establish 
        some form of German industrial sound." </p>
      <p> In the late '60s, there was a concerted attempt to create a distinctively 
        German popular music. Liberated by the influence of Fluxus (LaMonte Young 
        and Tony Conrad were frequent visitors to Germany during this period) 
        and Anglo-American psychedelia, groups like Can and Amon D&uuml;&uuml;l 
        began to sing in German --the first step in countering pop's Anglo-American 
        centrism. Another element in the mix was particularly European: electronic 
        composers like <a href="http://www.eecs.nwu.edu/~tisue/schaeffer.html">Pierre 
        Schaeffer</a> and <a
href="http://newalbion.com:70/0h/artists/stockhausenk/stockhausenk.html">Karlheinz 
        Stockhausen</a>, who, like Fluxus, continued Russolo's fascination with 
        the use of nonmusical instruments. </p>
      <p> Classically trained, H&uuml;tter and Schneider avoided the excesses 
        of their contemporaries, along with the guitar/bass/drums format. Their 
        early records are full of long, moody electronic pieces, using noise and 
        industrial elements --music being indivisible from everyday sounds. Allied 
        to this was a strong sense of presentation (the group logo for their first 
        three records was a traffic cone) which was part of a general move toward 
        control over every aspect of the music and image-making process: in 1973-74, 
        the group built their own studio in D&uuml;sseldorf, Kling Klang. </p>
      <p> At the same time, Kraftwerk bought a Moog synthesizer, which enabled 
        them to harness their long electronic pieces to a drum machine. The first 
        fruit of this was "Autobahn," a 22-minute motorway journey, from the noises 
        of a car starting up to the hum of cooling machinery. In 1975, an edited 
        version of "Autobahn" was a top 10 hit. It wasn't the first synth hit--that 
        honor belongs to Gershon Kingsley's hissing "Popcorn," performed by studio 
        group Hot Butter--but it wasn't a pure novelty either. </p>
      <p> The breakthrough came with 1977's <i>Trans-Europe Express</i>: again, 
        the concentration on speed, travel, pan-Europeanism. The album's center 
        is the 13-minute sequence that simulates a rail journey: the click-clack 
        of metal wheels on metal rails, the rise and fade of a whistle as the 
        train passes, the creaking of coach bodies, the final screech of metal 
        on metal as the train stops. If this wasn't astounding enough, 1978's 
        <i>Man Machine</i> further developed ideas of an international language, 
        of the synthesis between man and machine. </p>
      <p> The influence of these two records--and 1981's <i>Computer World</i>, 
        with its concentration on emerging computer technology--was immense. In 
        England, a new generation of synth groups emerged from the entrails of 
        punk: <a href="http://www.ing.umu.se/~da95jhn/tg.html">Throbbing Gristle</a>, 
        <a
href="http://138.38.32.34/~mapnjd/Music/cabaretVoltaire.html">Cabaret Voltaire</a>, 
        the Normal all began as brutalist noise groups, for whom entropy and destruction 
        were as important a part of technology as progress, but all of them were 
        moving toward <a href="http://bird.taponline.com/industrial/">industrial</a> 
        dance rhythms by 1976-79. </p>
      <p> The idea of electronic dance music was in the air from 1977 on. Released 
        as <a href="http://www.execpc.com/~ooffects/">disco</a> 12" records in 
        the U.S., cuts like "Trans-Europe Express" and "The Robots" coincided 
        with Giorgio Moroder's electronic productions for Donna Summer, especially 
        "I Feel Love." This in turn had a huge influence on Patrick Cowley's late 
        '70s productions for Sylvester: synth cuts like "You Make Me Feel Mighty 
        Real" and "Stars" were the start of gay disco. Before he died in 1982, 
        Cowley made his own synthetic disco record, the dystopian "Mind Warp." 
      </p>
      <p> More surprisingly, Kraftwerk had an immediate impact on black dance 
        music: as Afrika Bambaataa says in David Toop's <i>Rap Attack</i>, "I 
        don't think they even knew how big they were among the black masses back 
        in '77 when they came out with 'Trans-Europe Express.' When that came 
        out, I thought that was one of the best and weirdest records I ever heard 
        in my life." In 1981, Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force, together with 
        producer Arthur Baker, paid tribute with "Planet Rock," which used the 
        melody from "Trans-Europe Express" over the rhythm from "Numbers." In 
        the process they created <b>electro</b> and moved rap out of the Sugarhill 
        age. </p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <p> In the inevitable movement of musical ideas from the avant-garde to 
        pop, from black to white and back again, it's easy to forget that blacks--who 
        to many people in England must be the repository of qualities like soul 
        and authenticity--are equally as capable, if not more, of being technological 
        and futuristic as whites. A veiled racism is at work here. If you want 
        black concepts and black futurism, you need go no further than the mid-'70s 
        Parliafunkadelicment Thang, with its P-Funk language and extraterrestrial 
        visitations. </p>
      <p> Derrick May once described techno as "just like Detroit, a complete 
        mistake. It's like George Clinton and Kraftwerk stuck in an elevator." 
        "I've always been a music lover," says Juan Atkins. "Everything has a 
        subconscious effect on what I do. In the 1970s I was into <a href="http://www.acpub.duke.edu/~eja/pfunk.html">Parliament, 
        Funkadelic</a>; as far back as '69 they were making records like <i>Maggot 
        Brain</i>, <i>America Eats Its Young</i>. But if you want the reason why 
        that happened in Detroit, you have to look at a DJ called Electrifying 
        Mojo: he had five hours every night, with no format restrictions. It was 
        on his show that I first heard Kraftwerk." </p>
      <p> In 1981, Atkins teamed up with a fellow Washtenaw Community College 
        student, Vietnam veteran Richard Davies, who had decided to simply call 
        himself 3070. "He was very isolated," Atkins says; "He had one of the 
        first Roland sequencers, a Roland MSK-100. I was around when you had to 
        get a bass player, a guitarist, a drummer to make records: you had all 
        these egos flying around, it was hard to get a consistent thought. I wanted 
        to make electronic music but thought you had to be a computer programmer 
        to do it. I found out it wasn't as complicated as I thought. Our first 
        record was 'Alleys of Your Mind.' It sold about 15,000 locally." </p>
      <p> Atkins and 3070 called themselves <b>Cybotron</b>, a futuristic name 
        in line with the ideas they had taken from science fiction, P-Funk, Kraftwerk, 
        and Alvin Toffler's <i>The Third Wave</i>. "We had always been into futurism. 
        We had a whole load of concepts for Cybotron: a whole techno-speak dictionary, 
        an overall idea which we called the Grid. It was like a video game which 
        you entered on different levels." By 1984-85, they had racked up some 
        of the finest electronic records ever, produced in their home studio in 
        Ypsilanti: tough, otherworldly yet warm cuts like "Clear," "R-9", and 
        the song that launched the style, "<b>Techno City</b>." </p>
      <p> Like Kraftwerk, Cybotron celebrated the romance of technology, of the 
        city, of speed, using purely electronic instruments and sounds. One of 
        their last records, "Night Drive," features a disembodied voice whispering 
        details of rapid, nocturnal transit in an intimate, seductive tone --this 
        set against a background of terminal industrial decay. After the riots 
        of June 1967, Detroit went, as Ze'ev Chafets writes in <i>Devil's Night</i>, 
        "in one generation from a wealthy white industrial giant to a poverty- 
        stricken black metropolis." Starved of resources while the wealth remains 
        in rich, white suburbs, the inner city has, largely, been left to rot. 
      </p>
      <p> Much has been made of Detroit's blasted state--and indeed, analogous 
        environments can be found in England, in parts of London, Manchester, 
        Sheffield, which may well account for techno's popularity there--but Atkins 
        remains optimistic. "You can look at the state of Detroit as a plus," 
        says Atkins. "All right, you only take 15 minutes to get from one side 
        of the city center to the other, and the main department store is boarded 
        up, but we're at the forefron here. When the new technology came in, Detroit 
        collapsed as an industrial city, but Detroit is techno city. It's getting 
        better, it's coming back around." </p>
      <p> By 1985, 3070 was gone, permanently damaged by Vietnam. Atkins hooked 
        up with fellow Belleville High alumni Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson. 
        The three of them began recording together and separately, under various 
        names: Model 500 (Atkins), Reese (Saunderson), Mayday, R-Tyme, and Rhythim 
        is Rhythim (May). All shared an attitude toward making records--using 
        the latest in computer technology without letting machines do everything--and 
        a determination to overcome their environment; like Ma has said, " We 
        can do nothing but look forward." </p>
      <p> The trio put out a stream of records in the Detroit area on the Transmat 
        and KMS labels: many of these, like "No UFO's," "Strings of Life," "Rock 
        to the Beat," and "When He Used To Play," have the same tempo, about 120 
        bpm, and feature blank, otherworldly voices--which, paradoxically, communicate 
        intense emotion. These records--now rereleased in Europe on compilations 
        like <i>Retro Techno Detroit Definitive</i> (Network U.K.) or <i>Model 
        500: Classics</i> (R&S Belgium)--were as good, if not better, as anything 
        coming out of New York or even Chicago, but because of Detroit's isolation 
        few people in the U.S. heard them at the time. It took English entrepreneurs 
        to give them their correct place in the mainstream of dance culture. </p>
      <p> Like many others, Neil Rushton was galvanized by the electronic music 
        coming out of Chicago mid-decade, which was successfully codified in the 
        English market under the trade name &quot;<a href="history_of_house.html">house</a>.&quot; 
        A similar thing happened in Chicago as in Detroit: away from the musical 
        mainstream on both coasts, DJs like Frankie Knuckles and Marshall Jefferson 
        had revived a forgotten musical form, disco, and adapted it to the environment 
        of gay clubs like the Warehouse. The result was a spacey, electronic sound, 
        released on local labels like Trax and DJ International: funkier and more 
        soulful than techno, but futuristic. As soon as it was marketed in the 
        U.K. as house in early 1987, it because a national obsession with No. 
        1 hits like "Love Can't Turn Around" and "Jack Your Body." </p>
      <p> <a href="http://rg.media.mit.edu/RG/RG.html">House</a> irrevocably turned 
        around English pop music. After the successes of these early records by 
        Steve "Silk" Hurley and Farley "Jackmaster" Funk (with disco diva Darryl 
        Pandy), pop music was dance music, and, more often than not, futuristic 
        black dance music at that. The apparent simplicity of these records coincided 
        with the coming onstream of digital technology whereby, in Atkins's words, 
        "you have the capability of storing a vast amount of information in a 
        smaller place." The success of the original house records opened up more 
        trends: <b>acid house</b>--featuring the Roland 303-- was followed by 
        <b>Italian house</b>, and later, Belgian <a href="http://www.isisnet.com/spacelab/synthesis/bnbif.html"> 
        New Beat's slower, more industrial dance rhythms</a>. </p>
      <p> "The U.K. likes discovering trends," Rushton says. "Because of the way 
        that the media works, dance culture happens very quickly. It's not hard 
        to hype something up." House slotted right into the mainstream English 
        pop taste for fast, four-on-the-floor black dance music that began with 
        <a href="http://www.musicbase.co.uk/music/motown/">Tamla</a> in the early 
        '60s (for many English people the first black music they heard). In the 
        '70s, obscure mid-'60s Detroit area records had been turned into a way 
        of life, a religion even, in the style called "Northern Soul" by dance 
        writer Dave Godin. </p>
      <p> "I was always a Northern Soul freak," says Rushton. "When the first 
        techno records came in, the early Model 500, Reese, and Derrick May material, 
        I wanted to follow up the Detroit connection. I took a flyer and called 
        up Transmat; I got Derrick May and we started to release his records in 
        England. At that time, Derrick was recording on very primitive analog 
        equipment: 'Nude Photo,' for instance, was done straight onto cassette, 
        and that was the master. When you're using that equipment, you must keep 
        the mixes very simple. You can't overdub, or drop too many things in; 
        that's why it's so sparse. </p>
      <p> "Derrick came over with a bag of tapes, some of which didn't have any 
        name: tracks which are now classics, like 'Sinister' and 'Strings of Life.' 
        Derrick then introduced us to Kevin Saunderson, and we quickly realized 
        that there was a cohesive sound of these records, and that we could do 
        a really good compilation album. We got backing from Virgin Records and 
        flew to Detroit. We met Derrick, Kevin, and Juan and went out to dinner, 
        trying to think of a name. </p>
      <p> "At the time, everything was house, house house. We thought of Motor 
        City House Music, that kind of thing, but Derrick, Kevin, and Juan kept 
        on using the word <b><i>techno</i></b>. They had it in their heads without 
        articulating it; it was already part of their language." Rushton's team 
        returned to England with 12 tracks, which were released on an album called 
        <i>Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit</i>, with a picture of the Detroit 
        waterfront at night. At the time, it seemed like just another hype, but 
        within a couple of months Kevin Saunderson had a huge U.K. hit with Inner 
        City's pop oriented "Big Fun," and techno entered the language. </p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> The sheer exponential expansion of dance music in Europe since house 
        is attributable to several factors. First, the sheer quality of the records 
        coming out of the U.S., whether swingbeat, rap, New York garage, house 
        or techno. Secondly acid house--acid being a Chicago term for the wobbly 
        bassline and trancey sounds that started to come in from 1987 on--coincided 
        with the widespread European use of the psychedelic <a href="http://hyperreal.com/drugs/mdma/">Ecstasy</a>. 
        In Europe, acid house meant psychedelic house, and this drug-derived subculture 
        has become the single largest fashion in England and across the continent; 
        gatherings of up to 5000 people were common after 1988 and have become 
        an important circuit for breaking hits. </p>
      <p> Thirdly, the deceptively simple sound of the Detroit and Chicago records, 
        together with the spread of digital technology like the Roland 808 sequencer 
        [<i>sic.</i>], encouraged Europeans to make their own records cheaply, 
        often in their own home studios, from the mid decade. The long delay between 
        Kraftwerk's 1981 <i>Computer World</i> and 1986 <i>Electric Cafe</i> occurred 
        in part because the group was converting its Kling Klang studio from analog 
        to digital. The result is greater flexibility, more sto rage space, and 
        more sonic possibilities --vital in an area of music as fast-moving and 
        competitive as the dance economy. </p>
      <p> The big English breakthrough came in 1988 with S'Express's no. 1 hit 
        "Theme From S'Express"--a playful reworking of that old travel motif, 
        with Karen Finley and hairspray samples for percussion. The acid sound 
        development from the Roland 808 explorations of Phuture's "Acid Tracks"--the 
        sound of buzzing bees discovered by accident from a synthesizer straight 
        out of the shop. Squeezed, bent, oscillated, this buzz became the staple 
        of the 1988-89 acid boom; you can hear an early English version on Baby 
        Ford's proto-hardcore "Ooochy Koochy Fuck You Baby Yeah Yeah." </p>
      <p> By 1990, the relentless demand for new dance music was such that, in 
        Neil Rushton's words, "The Detroit innovators couldn't take it to the 
        next stage. What did was that kids in the U.K. and Europe started learning 
        how to make those techno records. They weren't as well-made, but they 
        had the same energy. And, by 1990-91, things became more interesting, 
        because instead of three people in Detroit, you suddenly had 23 people 
        making techno, in Belgium, in Sheffield." </p>
      <p> Beltram's "Energy Flash" released on the Belgian R&S Records in early 
        1991, defined the new mood. Inherent in the man/machine aesthetic is a 
        certain brutality that goes right back to the macho posturings of the 
        Futurist F.T. Marinetti: even in records as soulful as those made by Model 
        500, you'll find titles like "Off to Battle." With its in-your-face bass, 
        speeded up industrial rhythms and whispered chants of "Ecstasy," "Energy 
        Flash" caught the transition from Detroit techno to today's hardcore --the 
        aesthetic laid out for all time on Human Resource's "Dominator:" "I'm 
        bigger and bolder and rougher and tougher / In other words, sucker, there 
        is no other / I wanna kiss myself." </p>
      <p> "In Belgium we had all the influences," says R&S label owner Renaat 
        Vandepapeliere. "We had new beat, which was slowed-down industrial music. 
        Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle were very big in Belgium. Detroit 
        techno and acid house came in and everything got mixed up together." Other 
        Beltram cuts like "Sub-Bass Experience," with its sensuous psychedelic 
        textures and rock samples, pointed the way forward to other R&S releases 
        like the Aphex Twin's "Analogue Bubblebath," which spun techno off into 
        yet another direction. </p>
      <p> In England, the techno take-up came not in London or Manchester (which 
        by then was busy with rock/dance groups like the Happy Mondays), but in 
        Sheffield, an industrial city about 200 miles away from London, on the 
        other side of the Pennine Hills fro Manchester, which in the late '70s 
        spawned its own electronic scene with Cabaret Voltaire and The Human League. 
        "There are no live venues here in Sheffield," says WARP Records co-owner 
        Rob Mitchell. "The only way to be in a band and be successful is to make 
        dance records. </p>
      <p> "All these industrial places influence the music that you make. Electronic 
        music is relevant because of the subliminal influence of industrial sounds. 
        You go around Sheffield and it's full of crap concrete architecture built 
        in the '60's; you go down in to an area called the Canyon and you have 
        these massive black factories belching out smoke, banging away. They don't 
        sound a lot different from the music." You can hear this in early industrial 
        cuts by Cabaret Voltaire, like 1978's "The Set Up," with its deep throbbing 
        pulse. </p>
      <p> In 1989, CV's Richard Kirk was looking for a new way to operate. "Cabaret 
        Voltaire had just finished a period on a major label, EMI, and we weren't 
        working together. I spent a lot of time going to clubs, and working in 
        the studio with Parrot, a DJ who ran the city's main club night, Jive 
        Turkey. We made a record, as Sweet Exorcist, called 'Test One,' which 
        we made to play in the club. It was very, very minimal. WARP was a shop 
        where everyone bought American imports, and they put it out. We started 
        to move seriously in that direction." </p>
      <p> WARP released "Test One" in mid 1990. By the end of the year they had 
        two top 20 hits with LFO and Tricky Disco, both with eponymous dance cuts. 
        The WARP material is less brutal than the Belgian techno: still using 
        crunch industrial sounds, but more minimal, more playful. And then another 
        change occurred as techno went hardcore in 1991. "I didn't like the hardcore 
        stuff," says Mitchell. "It was too simplistic, crude and aggressive. We 
        were getting sent lots of tracks that we couldn't sell on singles, so 
        we thought, 'Let's just do an LP.' We got the title, <i>Artificial Intelligence</I>, 
        and a concept: 'Electronic music for the mind created by trans-global 
        electronic innovators who prove music is the one true universal language.'" 
      </p>
      <p> The cover of <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> is a computer-generated 
        image: a robot lies back in an armchair, relaxing after a Sapporo and 
        what looks like a joint. On the floor surrounding him are album sleeves: 
        the first WARP compilation, featuring LFO and Sweet Exorcist among others, 
        Kraftwerk's <i>Autobahn</i>, and Pink Floyd's <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>. 
        The music inside has slower beats, and is a ways away from the minimal 
        funkiness of Detroit techno; cuts by the Dice Man, the Orb, and Musicology 
        are nothing other than a modern, dance-oriented psychedelia. </p>
      <p> Featured on the album was the then 17-year-old Richard James, who, under 
        his most familiar pseudonym Aphex Twin, has become the star of what most 
        people now call ambient techno--although it doesn't quite have a name 
        yet. Coincidental to the <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> compilation, R&S 
        released the Aphex Twin's <i>Selected Ambient Works 85-92</i>, which developed 
        a huge underground reputation at the end of last year. With its minimal, 
        archetypal graphics --a mutated boomerang shape on the sleeve--the <i>Ambient 
        Works</i> album trashed the boundaries between acid, techno, ambient, 
        and psychedelic. It defined a new techno primitive romanticism. </p>
      <p> When Richard James was finally found and interviewed, he came up with 
        a story that has already become myth: how the by-now 19-year-old student 
        from Cornwall (a remote part of the U.K.) recorded under a bewildering 
        variety of pseudonyms--the Aphex Twin, Polygon Window, Dice Man, and Caustic 
        Window, to name but a few--how he built his own electronic machines to 
        make the speaker-shredding noises you hear on his records; how he already 
        has 20 albums recorded and ready to go. WARP plans to release his next 
        ambient collection as a triple-CD set with a graphic novel. </p>
      <p> The Aphex Twin's success comes at a moment when, in England and on the 
        continent, one wing of techno is going toward ambience. The slowing pace 
        is partly in response to the still-popular working class fashion of hardcore, 
        which regularly throws up generic chart hits like those by Altern-8 and 
        the Prodigy. At the same time as the drug supply in clubland has changed 
        from Ecstasy to amphetamines, hardcore has gone far beyond the linear 
        brutalities of "The Dominator" into a seamless dystopia of speeded up 
        breakbeats, horror lyrics, and ur-punk vocal chants. Like gangsta rap, 
        it's scary, and it's meant to be. </p>
      <p> "Ninety per cent of the techno records you hear now are made for a fucked-up 
        dance floor," says Renaat Vandepapeliere. "That's what I see now in a 
        lot of clubs: no vibe, no motivation, aggression--the drugs have taken 
        over. The majority don't understand it yet, but most of the guys who are 
        really good, like Derrick May, don't take drugs. Techno was a sound but 
        it is now an attitude, and that's to make records for drug-oriented people. 
        There is another category, where people are making music for you to pay 
        attention with your full mind, and we're trying to make something now 
        that will last." </p>
      <p> "I believe that the '70s are parallel for what's going on in the '90s," 
        says WARP's Rob Mitchell. "Musical moods tend to be a reaction against 
        what has just gone on; we've just had a very aggressive period. The original 
        Detroit techno is very sophisticated. What we're putting out now--Wild 
        Planet, F.U.S.E.--has a similar level of sophistication. The real change 
        for us since we started is the fact that this music is 99 per cent white, 
        but the idea of raising techno to an artier level is really exciting." 
      </p>
      <p> If the '70s are back, then it's the early part of the decade: you can 
        see 1970-71 in the long hair and loose clothes of R&S/WARP acts like the 
        Aphex Twin, Source, C.J. Bolland; you can read it in their titles ("Neuromancer," 
        "Aquadrive," "Hedphelym"); you can hear the hints of <a href="http://newalbion.com:70/artists/rileyt/rileyt.html">Terry 
        Riley</a>, German romanticists <a href="http://www.compusmart.ab.ca/tbennett/cluster.htm">Cluster</a> 
        and <a
href="http://www.eecs.uic.edu/~jstamato/ks/klaus_schulze.html">Klaus Schulze</a>, 
        even <a
href="http://dutrun2.tudelft.nl/~cboalou/jarrewww.htm">Jean-Michel Jarre</a>. 
        The very idea of boy keyboard wizards goes back to that moment in the 
        early '70s when Kraftwerk began their electronic experiments, when rock 
        went progressive. Techno has moved into psychedelia with groups like Orbital; 
        now it's gone prog. </p>
      <p> It's hard to avoid the impression that ambient has come as a godsend 
        to the music industry. The very success of the dance-music economy has 
        thrown up problems, as Rob Mitchell explains: "There is virtually no artist 
        loyalty in dance music; the record is more important than the artist. 
        Dance is incredibly fast moving, which is good, but very difficult to 
        build careers in." With ambient acts like the Aphex Twin, the music industry 
        has something it recognizes and knows how to promote: the definable white 
        rock artists, as opposed to the anonymous, often black, record. And ambient 
        techno also slots directly into the music industry's most profitable form 
        of hardware: the CD. </p>
      <p> The term <a href="http://hyperreal.com/ambient/"><i>ambient</i></a> 
        was popularized by <a
href="http://hyperreal.com/music/artists/eno/">Brian Eno</a> in the late '70s. 
        The percussionless, subtle tonalities of records like <i>Music for Airports</i> 
        were perfect for the CD format when it came onstream in the mid '80s. 
        Ambient techno and its kitsch associate, New Age, are the modern equivalent 
        of the exotic sound experience that developed to fit the technologies 
        of the '50s. Just as mass distribution of the LP and the home hi-fi gave 
        us film soundtracks and Martin Denny, the CD and the Discman have given 
        us ambient techno. </p>
      <p> Ambient could go horribly wrong, but hasn't yet. A cyberpunk/computer 
        games aesthetic is always patched somewhere into the screen, but is not 
        obtrusive. Inherent in the genre is a lightness of touch, and a rhythmic 
        discipline that comes from its Detroit source. The best material, like 
        Biosphere's <i>Microgravity</i> and Sandoz's <i>Digital Lifeforms</i>, 
        also has a holistic spirituality that goes back to the Detroit records. 
        As Sandoz's Richard Kirk says, "I've been making music for a long time. 
        Much of it has been very cold, very aggressive, very stark. It's time 
        to do something that makes you feel good, that makes you feel warm." </p>
      <p> Recorded by a 27-year-old from Norway, <a href="http://www.math.uio.no/music/bel-canto/Biosphere/">Geir 
        Jennsen (a/k/a Biosphere)</a>, <i>Microgravity</i> stands at the apex 
        of ambient. Its nine cuts (sample title: "Cloudwater II") form a perfectly 
        segued 45-minute whole that balances the utopian/dystopian pull inherent 
        in the machine aesthetic. Their ebb and flow, between fast and slow, between 
        playful and awful, between moon and sun, holds some of the queasy balance 
        within which we live. At the end, a resolution: "Biosphere" merges the 
        sound of technology--the thrum of heavy industry, an electric alarm--into 
        a bass pulse and atmospheric effects, warning but enclosing. The last 
        sound is wind. </p>

      <br>
      <p> Techno, how far can you go? "A lot of it was kind of as we planned," 
        says Juan Atkins, "but nobody knew it would be a global thing as it is 
        now, from little Detroit." "We have played and been understood in Detroit 
        and Japan," says Ralf H&uuml;tter; "That's the most fascinating thing 
        that could happen. Electronic music is a kind of world music. It may be 
        a couple of generations yet, but I think that the global village is coming." 
      </p>
      <p> The computer virus is loose. Right now, techno presents itself as a 
        paradox of possibilities (and limitations, the most glaring being gender: 
        where are the women in this boys' world?). In its many forms, techno shows 
        that within technology there is emotion, that within information access 
        there is overload, that within speed lies entropy, that within progress 
        lies destruction, that within the materiality of inanimate objects can 
        lie spirituality. </p>
      <p> These tensions have been programmed into our art and culture since the 
        turn of the century, and it is fitting that at the century's end, a form 
        has come along which can synthesize the encroaching vortex of the millennium. 
        You can do anything with techno, and people will. As our past, present, 
        and future start to spin before our eyes, and our feet start to slip, 
        the positivism inherent in techno remains a guide: like Juan Atkins says, 
        "I'm very optimistic. This is a very good time to be alive right now."
