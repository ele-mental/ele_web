      think of detroit and you automatically think of motown, but be careful not 
      to think too loud because the new grandmasters of detroit techno hate history.<br>
      <br>
      juan atkins, 26 years old, and the self proclaimed captain of the techno 
      sound is an articulate enemy of motown's supreme being. "berry gordy built 
      the motown sound on the same principle as the conveyor belt at the ford 
      plant. today the automobile plants use robots and computers to make their 
      cars and i'm more interested in fords robots than gordy's music."<br>
      <br>
      techno music is unashamedly modern in it's out-look. it is a mesmerising 
      underground of new music which looks to the future, breaks with the past 
      and blends european industrial pop with black american garage funk. according 
      to derrick may, the immensely gifted young producer who works under the 
      pseudonyms rhythim is rhythim and mayday, his music goes "beyond the beat". 
      it is not simply dance music but a series of sound experiments that often 
      defy the logic of more uncomplicated dance sounds like chicago house.<br>
      <br>
      the origins of techno date back to the late 70's to the supressed identity 
      of european synthesiser groups like kraftwerk and yello and to british electronic 
      funk groups like heaven 17, new order and the human league. their music 
      established the synthesiser as the creative core of new music, encouraging 
      a whole generation of young musicians to turn their basements into makeshift 
      studios. unknown to europe the ears of black america were listening with 
      increasing facsination reversing the age-old flow of musical influence.<br>
      <br>
      in west detroit, juan atkins a student at the city's belleville high school 
      and an obsessive fan of kraftwerk, began to compose basic drum patterns 
      on an old roland d115 eventually graduating to more complex synthesiser 
      tracks which borrowed heavily from europe.<br>
      <br>
      juan's first group cybotron released several records at the height of the 
      electro-funk boom in the early 80's, the most succesful being a truly progressive 
      homage to the city of detroit simply entitled 'techno city'. at the time 
      he believed the record was a unique and adventurous piece of synthesiser 
      funk, more in tune with germany than the rest of black america, but on a 
      dispiriting visit to new york, juan heard afrika bambaataa's 'planet rock' 
      and realised that his vision of a spartan electronic dance sound had been 
      upstaged.<br>
      <br>
      he returned to detroit to renew his friendship with 2 younger students from 
      belleville high, kevin saunderson and derrick may, and quietly over the 
      next few years the three of them became the creative backbone of detroit 
      techno.<br>
      <br>
      most of the tracks on this lp are the work of the belleville 3, juan's 'techno 
      music' and the kevin saunderson experience's 'electronic dance' reflect 
      the basic studio beat of techno, whilst derrick may's rhythim is rhtyhim 
      track takes the music into the most unlikely areas turning new age ambience 
      and film-soundtrack instrumentation into complex dance music.<br>
      <br>
      derrick may is undoubtedly the philosopher of techno! he sees the music 
      as post-soul and believes it marks a deliberate break with previous traditions 
      of black american music. "the music is just like detroit" he claims, "a 
      complete mistake, it's like george clinton and kraftwerk are stuck in an 
      elevator with only a sequencer to keep them company."<br>
      <br>
      amidst the experimental strangeness of this album are other more obviously 
      commercial dance records. 'share this house' by members of the house which 
      actually features george clinton as an uncredited visiting producer, takes 
      its main influences from the chicago jack virus.<br>
      <br>
      inevitably the detroit techno sound will be compared to the music of the 
      nearby city of chicago,a problem that neither angers nor concerns the producers 
      of techno! blake baxter, detroit's soft spoken sex symbol, and the whispered 
      mind behind the promiscous 'ride em boys', has already had several hits 
      in the chicago area, and derrick may's best known records to date - 'nude 
      photo' & 'strings' - were instrumental in taking chicago's music into the 
      abstract and lysergic mood now described as 'acid house.'<br>
      <br>
      but derrick believes there's a huge differance between chicago house and 
      detroit techno! "it's a question of respect, house still has it's heart 
      in 70's disco, we don't have any of that respect for the past, it's strictly 
      future music. we have a much greater aptitude for experimentation."<br>
      <br>
      techno is undoubtedly the music of detroit but it has none of the latter 
      day optimism of motown. the city is reflected in the music in an unsettling 
      way. "factories are closing and people are drifting away" says derrick, 
      "the old industrial detroit is falling apart, the structures have collapsed. 
      it's the murder capital of america. six year olds carry guns and thousands 
      of black people have stopped caring if they ever work again. if you make 
      music in that environment it can't be straight music. in britain you have 
      new order, well our music is the new disorder."<br>
      <br>
      techno's sudden shift of tempo and relentless war on familiarity makes it 
      sound like free form jazz for the computer era. it may well be the music 
      of the new disorder but it promises to join george clinton's funkadelia 
      and prince's minneaplois sound as one of the most experimental forms of 
      music black america has ever produced. </font></td>
