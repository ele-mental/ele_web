        The record industry is in the process of being outflanked by means of 
        the very processes that it has come to rely upon. Since the 60's its continual 
        efforts to create new needs has meant that it nurtured an everchanging 
        musical soundscape that is now mutating at such a pace that it cannot 
        keep track long enough to harness these musical evolutions in the direction 
        of profit. That fact that it doesn't achieve this harnessing has the remarkable 
        effect of making the 'new' last longer! A longevity that comes from our 
        always being able to place ourselves amidst a continual re-definition 
        of these sounds. Even in terms of format, the profit-orientated shift 
        to a CD market which may have meant that back-catalogues could be re-sold 
        has also worked to deliver an on-line tap of musical history at the same 
        time that vinyl pressing has become cheaper. These and other factors feed 
        into the accelerating mutation that in turn creates a dissatisfaction 
        with what the industry can offer.</font>

        Advancements in technology have meant that all manner of equipment is 
        now available for re-appropriation by whoever has the time to learn how 
        to use, re-define, misuse and re-wire it. That there can no longer be 
        any "one sound" around which music is organised means that everything 
        is potential material to a practice that no longer calls itself music. 
        Indeed, the former categories that were alloted to different musics, now 
        only make sense as a means of division, a consumer yardstick. From the 
        guitar we have moved through sampling technology, turntables, tape, analogue 
        and digital keyboards, from Rock, Disco, Punk through Techno, Jungle and 
        Trip-Hop[ to an indiscernable melange that creates further possibilities 
        for interaction as well as enhanced and de-legitimated conditions of reception. 
        Both of these escape the institutional control of the industry and the 
        media and in so doing, the means to escape the "dominant repressive models" 
        of an inherited subjectivity have been forged.</font>

        Ever since 'music' got rid of the necessity for lyrics, the predominance 
        of an electronic based music of texture, unrestricted tonality, timbral 
        density, and rhythmic paroxysm, meant that it was liberating those who 
        heard it to listen more closely to the rhythms and sounds they did not 
        recognise. Happening in the context of dance music means that this process 
        of heightened listening was essential as it was cerebral and because these 
        sounds took people in un-heard of directions they became situated as part 
        of a collective desire that pre-disposed them to each other, inspiring 
        movements towards new forms of collectivity. The liberation of the listener, 
        through dance, lead not only to a growing sociality, the collective memory 
        of tracks, but to an increased confidence necessary for the continual 
        perpetuation of these desires for discovery and self-creation.</font>

        As a consequence there are more people making music now than at any time 
        before and awareness of this amongst composers has led to an international 
        explosion of small label activity. These people have heard the tired tales 
        of music scene has-beens and rather than choose competition, exposure 
        and the labour of 'success' they have decided to operate outside these 
        constraints and do their own thing. Similar to and inspired by the free-party 
        scene, small-run pressings of records are passed around through underground 
        distribution networks at a level that eludes even the most 'specialist' 
        of record shops. In the slipstream of this there has been the rise of 
        an experimental attitude: no longer needing to conform to what is expected 
        and 'understood' means that there has been a renewed appreciation for 
        the idiosyncrasies of sound and the transgression of perceptual habits 
        these can inspire.</font>

        Meanwhile, A&amp;R men scurry from club to gig to rave but never reach 
        the parties. Attracted to the music that makes sense and money they can 
        never hear desire. The surrogate A&amp;R arm of the music press and style 
        mags are increasingly losing their role as mediators between 'unknown' 
        composers and the major labels. This reliance between the two to pick 
        up on trends and promote the 'new' is becoming laughable when the 'new' 
        is now passing-by unnoticed making such attempts to hold on to what has 
        been declared 'new', the very indication that what we read is insincere, 
        careerist crap. Similarly, the way these magazines always cover the same 
        things is an indication of their fear of different perspectives that threaten 
        to show how the trends are fabricated in the first place.</font>

        The Post-Media practice has been accelerated by the world-wide-web where 
        obsessions run rife and where there is this noticeable desire for those 
        driven and miniaturised activities that exist and thrive without giving 
        a thought to the increasingly "calm perspectives" of a transparent media. 
        The media, like the record industry, has become a centralised zero. Where 
        once magazines and labels may have acted as a filter or a means of dissemination, 
        market forces made all these converge on the centre-ground. The public 
        listens to what is made available... and what the audience happens to 
        listen to, since it was being offered, reinforces certain tastes (1). 
        Mistaken as a cutting-edge the music promoted by the media often serves 
        no other purpose than the maintanence of a profitable illusion. Caught 
        in this mystifying spiral listeners either attempt to break-loose and 
        do it for themselves or, having their senses dulled, become bored and 
        unable to orientate themselves within the media-trap of publicity and 
        failed promise. The latter become as dispassionate and cynical as the 
        columns they read, and taking their place in the aging process they see 
        in the next cicle of mediated-music a lack of innovation and quality.</font> 
      <p> <font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        Innovation and quality? It is interesting to see how the media, which 
        ostensibly sees itself as operating in opposition to "high-art", comes 
        to work in consort with this traditionalism, and in particular through 
        the way that it reinforces reactionary notions of subjectivity. Formost 
        among these shared techniques is the way that music, like art, is more 
        or less always portrayed as trancendental, as isolated from the social 
        conditions that produce, celebrate and receive it. This individualistic 
        means of relating to music is accentuated by the reliance on 'genius': 
        the elevation of certain individuals and the furthering of hierachic devices 
        in the supposedly 'free-space' of popular music. This accent on the 'unique' 
        can result in subduing the activities of others and in a denial of inter-relatedness 
        that adds up to making the practice that surrounds music invisible. Whatsmore, 
        this has the contingent effect of privileging the 'solitary' moment of 
        production over that of listening, dancing and organising which always 
        imply the presence of others. In this way the contagious effects of music 
        that can be conducted through sound are made tame. The media inhibits, 
        or even worse, removes desire and in so doing colludes with the capitalisation 
        of subjectivity... One space, one time, one person just one step ahead 
        of boredom and resignation.</font> 
      <p> <font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        This musical contagion has been gradually enhanced by the new conditions 
        of reception and no small part of this Post-Media practice has been stimulated 
        by the growing sense that listening is not a subordinate activity but 
        a process of making meaning. From headphones to speakers, the bedroom 
        to the party, alone yet always connected and dialoguing, listeners become 
        part of an autonomous, diffuse and non-institutional reception context. 
        This quite complex configuration means than rather than the 'new' and 
        the 'unheard-of' being consumed voraciously in a frenzy of consumption 
        they are turned into consoles that produce energy, impulsional exchanges, 
        and stimulate a practice of non-conceptional thought. The constant movement 
        this engenders can be placed in stark contrast to the way that mediatised-music 
        can often be a means of falling back upon what is already known, a collapsing 
        onto the pre-ordained terrain of the self. But if listening is taken seriously 
        and not maintained as a second-rate activity it can only encourage patterns 
        of connection and come-experience with an immediately accessible group 
        that shares not onlyan appreciation of the sounds but to some degree the 
        social-memory of them as contained within the record. Once linked in this 
        way the bonds of a 'new collectivity' become almost an unconscious reflex. 
        Not cool but supercool.</font>

        And so post-media becomes a practice that knows no bounds or discipline. 
        It is a web-site, a zine, a limited-run-record-label, a pirate station, 
        a flyer, a poster, a video circulated throught the post, the telling of 
        stories and news around a pub table, a distribution network of unseen 
        nodes, ephemeral organisations, a promulgation of fiction... It is a de-channeled, 
        meta-categorical social practice of cultural creation, made entirely for 
        and on its own terms! It is driven by desire, enthusiasm, search and connection 
        towards a polyphonic subjectivity! At times anything is possible. Rational 
        modes of discourse like journalism and writing theses which act to stabilise 
        and make things remain still long enough for them to become systemised 
        have very little sense that the music they write about is a fuel that 
        traverses disparate regions, bringing into collision elements from each. 
        Within this Post-Media practice there is an intensified re-definition 
        of the old dualisms of producer/consumer, subject/collective, success/failure. 
        In relation to the latter it can often be that in such a post-media space 
        respect and support is given to those who succeed in creating, at personal 
        cost, something that is illegitimate and dissensual. In this way judgement 
        of its value, whether it's good or bad, is rendered null and void. But 
        such scenes, operating intimately cannot afford to establish divisions: 
        listeners become producers, composers, dancers, writers. Everyone is involved. 
        All scenes are their own genre, and operating in a dispersed geographic 
        and sidekick space there is no sense of any one person, group or scene 
        being in control: it is a practice of addition without accumulation, a 
        group-effusion of singularity dispensing with individualism. In the past 
        one of the main drawbacks has been that such affirmative practices have 
        felt the need to be delimited as regions where protagonists should be 
        made visible to each other. The onset of the Web has put paid to this 
        by extending our expectations of communication, transposing a virtual 
        space of music into an actuality of intimacy (libidinal musics) and an 
        ever present potential for subjective change. In the words of Guattari.. 
        It is no longer the end that matters but the 'milieu', the process becoming 
        processual... One does not want to enter into a pre-established program. 
        One tries to live the field of the possible... (2).</font>
