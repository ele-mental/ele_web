      <H2>The Roots of Techno</H2>
      [sidebar:]<br>
      <br>
      Berry Gordy's Motown may no longer rule the airwaves, but Detroit has found 
      a new beat. Since 1981, the compositions of techno visionary Juan Atkins 
      have sent shock waves through contemporary music. On the heels of the German 
      group Kraftwerk, he and partner Rick Davis formed Cybotron, fusing austere 
      European techno-pop with street-level funk. In 1985, Atkins formed Metroplex 
      Records, not knowing that his unique brand of techno would soon inspire 
      the anthems and soundtracks of the digital age -- the latest world music. 
      Wired spoke with Atkins about his early inspirations and how they may bring 
      about musical metamorphosis on a wider scale. His current projects include 
      the 12-inch single "I See the Light" (Metroplex, Detroit) and the LP Sonic 
      Sunset (R&#38;S Records, Belgium), both under the moniker "Model 500."<br>
      <br>
      <B>Wired:</B> What is your definition of techno? Is it essentially a combination 
      of technology and funk?<br>
      <br>
      <B>Atkins:</B> Yes. it's interesting, because I met Karl Bartos (formerly 
      of Kraftwerk) and he told me that one of his influences was James Brown. 
      Today, I think "techno" is a term to describe and introduce all kinds of 
      electronic music. In fact, there were a lot of electronic musicians around 
      when Cybotron started, and I think maybe half of them referred to their 
      music as "techno." However, the public really wasn't ready for it until 
      about '85 or '86. It just so happened that Detroit was there when people 
      really got into it.<br>
      <br>
      <B>W:</B> What separates Detroit techno from other music, like Chicago's 
      house movement?<br>
      <br>
      <B>A:</B> It's always been about insight and forward thinking. It goes as 
      far as the science fiction I was into early on and the class I took in high 
      school called "Future Studies." One of the textbooks I had to read was Alvin 
      Toffler's _Future Shock_. Also, Detroit is unlike any other city in the 
      transitions it has endured. When your surroundings change, you go through 
      change.<br>
      <br>
      <B>W:</B> You've said elsewhere that the term "techno" was partially taken 
      from Toffler's term "techno-rebels" in _The Third Wave_ -- those who didn't 
      see the need for technology to be overwhelming or alienating. Does this 
      concept have anything to do with techno's use of older analog synthesizers 
      or keeping the production of vinyl alive?<br>
      <br>
      <B>A:</B> We never tried to apply any of those principles. The Third Wave 
      was only inspirational, although we did use hybrid words like "cybotron" 
      and "metroplex," and Toffler spoke of these futuristic combinations.<br>
      <br>
      <B>W:</B> Techno-rebels notwithstanding, some technologies are absorbed 
      very quickly into our culture. Does it surprise you how slowly the United 
      States has embraced electronic music, dance-oriented or otherwise?<br>
      <br>
      <B>A:</B> Not surprised, really. Disappointed is the word. I was more surprised 
      when I first went to Europe and found that white kids could enjoy dance 
      music. In this country it's very hard for creative thought to escape capitalism.<br>
      <br>
      <B>W:</B> How then do you explain the emergence of Detroit as an aesthetic 
      Mecca for electronic dance music, as opposed to larger cities like New York 
      and LA?<br>
      <br>
      <B>A:</B> Let's remember Detroit is representative of the whole Industrial 
      Revolution. When that came to a close, it was the first place hit. And because 
      of its lack of status, it's a lot more depressed than other areas. That 
      forces people to be creative.<br>
      <br>
      <B>W:</B> This creativity and work ethic, although a social requirement 
      of sorts, hasn't led to real status in the American music industry. Why 
      is it that you and other Detroit techno artists aren't officially recognized 
      as high-caliber musicians and producers?<br>
      <br>
      <B>A:</B> You have to wonder how, with as much press as we have received 
      worldwide, why we still don't have a proper record deal. (Pauses.) Maybe 
      in the marketing departments out there, there really are people who think 
      that a white techno act is more marketable than a black one... I don't know.<br>
      <br>
      <B>W:</B> What do you think is the problem with the way music is presented 
      to the masses?<br>
      <br>
      <B>A:</B> There has to be a revolution in radio in America. Instead of me 
      complaining, I'd rather take an active role as a program director and change 
      all that. If I'm the only guy to take a station and set an example, then 
      that's what I'll do. I can also guarantee that this station would be Number 
      One in its market within a year.<br>
      <br>
      <B>W:</B> There are signs of this "neo-urban" music starting to flourish: 
      LA's _URB Magazine_, more and more stateside techno tours. Is this the kind 
      of movement you're hoping for?<br>
      <br>
      <B>A:</B> Yes. Definitely. There is no outlet for (techno artists). Right 
      now they put out 12-inch singles and sell 2,000 to 3,000 copies and get 
      discouraged. The basic problem is that in America, if you don't fit into 
      a radio format, you don't really exist.<br>
      <br>
      <B>W:</B> Given the structured and commercial nature of radio, do you see 
      those conventions bending to variety and innovation? Even public radio seems 
      to be "going corporate" these days.<br>
      <br>
      <B>A:</B> However I have to get into radio -- digital cable FM, low-power 
      radio -- that's what I'll do. I want to see techno take off on a major level, 
      and I don't agree that as soon as the money comes in, it will dilute the 
      quality of the music.<br>
      <br>
      <B>W:</B> You've said that people are ready for something different, that 
      they have caught up with technology to a certain degree. What kind of encouragement 
      do you have that radio will not continue to stagnate?<br>
      <br>
      <B>A:</B> There was a time seven or eight years ago when you could go into 
      a city and four out of five people didn't know what a sequencer was. Now 
      maybe one out of five doesn't. There is a ton of music here, kids are buying 
      Roland and Korg keyboards. And what are they doing? They're not making ballads!<br>
