      <b>AMBIENT MUSIC</b><br>
      <br>
      The concept of music designed specifically as a background feature in the 
      environment was pioneered by Muzak Inc. in the fifties, and has since come 
      to be known generically by the term Muzak. The connotations that this term 
      carries are those particularly associated with the kind of material that 
      Muzak Inc. produces - familiar tunes arranged and orchestrated in a lightweight 
      and derivative manner. Understandably, this has led most discerning listeners 
      (and most composers) to dismiss entirely the concept of environmental music 
      as an idea worthy of attention. <br>
      <br>
      Over the past three years, I have become interested in the use of music 
      as ambience, and have come to believe that it is possible to produce material 
      that can be used thus without being in any way compromised. To create a 
      distinction between my own experiments in this area and the products of 
      the various purveyors of canned music, I have begun using the term Ambient 
      Music. <br>
      <br>
      An ambience is defined as an atmosphere, or a surrounding influence: a tint. 
      My intention is to produce original pieces ostensibly (but not exclusively) 
      for particular times and situations with a view to building up a small but 
      versatile catalogue of environmental music suited to a wide variety of moods 
      and atmospheres. <br>
      <br>
      Whereas the extant canned music companies proceed from the basis of regularizing 
      environments by blanketing their acoustic and atmospheric idiosyncracies, 
      Ambient Music is intended to enhance these. Whereas conventional background 
      music is produced by stripping away all sense of doubt and uncertainty (and 
      thus all genuine interest) from the music, Ambient Music retains these qualities. 
      And whereas their intention is to `brighten' the environment by adding stimulus 
      to it (thus supposedly alleviating the tedium of routine tasks and levelling 
      out the natural ups and downs of the body rhythms) Ambient Music is intended 
      to induce calm and a space to think. <br>
      <br>
      Ambient Music must be able to accomodate many levels of listening attention 
      without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.<br>
