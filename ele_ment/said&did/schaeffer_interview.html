      <H3>Introduction: What is Musique Concrete and why is it so important today?</H3>
      Musique Concrete is music made of raw sounds: thunderstorms, steam-engines, 
      waterfalls, steel foundries... The sounds are not produced by traditional 
      acoustic musical instruments. They are captured on tape (originally, before 
      tape, on disk) and manipulated to form sound-structures.
      <P> The work method is therefore empirical. It starts from the concrete 
        sounds and moves towards a structure. In contrast, traditional classical 
        music starts from an abstract musical schema. This is then notated and 
        only expressed in concrete sound as a last stage, when it is performed.
      <P> Musique Concrete emerged in Paris in 1948 at the RTF (Radio Television 
        Francais). Its originator, leading researcher and articulate spokesman 
        was Pierre Schaeffer - at that time working as an electro-acoustic engineer 
        with the RTF.
      <P> Almost immediately, Musique Concrete found itself locked in mortal combat 
        not only with its opponents within traditionally notated music, but also 
        with Electronic Music, which emerged in Cologne in 1950 at the NWDR (Nord 
        West Deutscher Rundfunk). Electronic Music involved the use of precisely 
        controllable electronic equipment to generate the sound material - for 
        example, the oscillator, which can produce any desired wave-form, which 
        can then be shaped, modulated, etc...
      <P> At the time, the antagonism between Musique Concrete and Electronic 
        music seemed to revolve largely around the difference in sound material. 
        Over the decades, this difference has become less important, so that what 
        we now call 'Electroacoustic Music' is less concerned with the origin 
        of the sound material than with what is done with it afterwards.
      <P> The real difference, the most lasting difference, between Musique Concrete 
        and Electronic revolves around a basic disagreement as to the nature of 
        the whole project. For Musique Concrete, the essential character of music 
        as a human activity is such that the listening experience and the 'ear' 
        are crucial things. For Electronic Music, the priority is the idea, the 
        system, the perfection of control, of precise rationalization... to become 
        scientific...
      <P> And what is the situation today? We can say unequivocally that whole 
        areas of music - indeed, of aesthetic, humanist activity in general - 
        have been hived off to the scientific establishment with its vast industrial 
        and political power. Look at France today, with its megabuck prestige 
        science-music research centre IRCAM (Institut de recherche et coordination 
        acoustique/musique) situated underground next to the Beauborg. The concatenation 
        of state power, the technocrat elite, the production and consumption of 
        an irrational surplus technology, the corridors littered with last month's 
        computers - all this clearly testifies that the French state takes its 
        music seriously enough to embrace it in a kind of mutual death-pact of 
        technicization...
      <P> And this, in a nut-shell, is why Musique Concrete is important today; 
        because the opportunity is still there to use all the parameters of sound 
        and still make music and not pseudo-science... 
      <H3>Interview (2.5.86)</H3>
      Pierre Schaeffer: born Nancy, France in 1910. Developed a wide range of 
      interests in poetics, technics and philosophy. Became famous in the late 
      '40s when, working as a broadcast engineer for the Radio-Television Francaise, 
      he formulated the ideas and techniques of Musique Concrete and founded a 
      studio for tape composition. Collaborated with Pierre Henry on several of 
      the classic compositions in the genre, including Symphonie pour un homme 
      seul and the first Concrete opera, Orphee, staged at Donaueschingen in 1953. 
      In the last two decades he has concentrated on his work as a writer and 
      commentator on the state of western culture.
      <P> Tim Hodgkinson: born 1949. Studied social anthropology. Engaged in a 
        wide range of musical work - Henry Cow, 1968-78; The Work, 1980-82; and 
        numerous other projects since. Currently composing for orchestra and working 
        on a general theory of music.
      <P> The interview was conducted in French at the house of M. Schaeffer and 
        translated by Tim.

      <PRE>
TH: You are a writer, a thinker, and a radio sound-engineer. This
makes you, from the point of view of 'Music' with a capital 'M' -
something of an outsider. Do you think that, in moments of crisis, the
non-specialist has a particular and important role to play? I don't
know whether this is entirely correct, but I sense that, at the moment
when you came into music, around 1948, you were a non-specialist of
this kind...

PS: Yes. But chance alone doesn't explain why a non-specialist gets
involved in an area he doesn't know about. In my case there were
double circumstances. First of all, I'm not completely unknowledgeable
about music, because I come from a family of musicians: my father was
a violinist and my mother was a singer. I did study well - theory,
piano, cello, etc, so I'm not completely untrained. Secondly, I was an
electroacoustic engineer working for the French radio, so I was led to
study sound and what's called 'high fidelity' in sound. Thirdly, after
the war, in the '45 to '48 period, we had driven back the German
invasion but we hadn't driven back the invasion of Austrian music,
12-tone music. We had liberated ourselves politically, but music was
still under an occupying foreign power, the music of the Vienna
school.

So these were the three circumstances that compelled me to experiment
in music: I was involved in music; I was working with turntables (then
with tape-recorders); I was horrified by modern 12-tone music. I said
to myself, 'Maybe I can find something different... maybe salvation,
liberation, is possible.' Seeing that no-one knew what to do anymore
with DoReMi, maybe we had to look outside that... Unfortunately it
took me forty years to conclude that nothing is possible outside
DoReMi... In other words, I wasted my life.

TH: We'll certainly have to come back to that. Right now, I want to
ask you if you think that there is an inherent connection between what
seem to be simultaneous developments; that, on the one hand, there is
the crisis of traditional music - 12-tone and so forth - and on the
other, there are the new possibilities offered by technology,
possibilities of opening up new continents of sound. Sometimes this
seems to me to be merely a matter of luck. At other times it seems
that there must be an inherent reason...

PS: I would answer that this luck is deceptive. First, it doesn't
surprise me that traditional music has experienced a kind of
exhaustion in the 20th century - not forgetting that many musicians
started to look outside the traditional structures of
tonality. Debussy was looking at 6 note scales, Bartok was exploring
mode;tonality seemed to be exhausted.The impressionists, Debussy,
Faure, in France, did take a few steps forward. Then, after the
impressionists, we have a period of rigour, of barbarity, a period
seeking to re-establish something more solid. This is epitomised in
the Vienna school. At this point the Vienna school was also inspired
by scientific ideas, by a rigour coming from a discipline which wasn't
music but an algebraic equation.

So it seems that one of two things can happen in a period of high
technology; either .technology itself seems to come to the rescue of
art - which is in a state of collapse - (that was my starting point,
Musique Concrete with the tape-recorder, now electronic music, etc),
or it's the ideas of technology, ideas from mathematics, ideas with a
scientific aura, or real scientific ideas given an unreal relevance to
an art which is seeking its discipline - its ordering principles -
outside itself instead of within the source of its own
inspiration. This coincidence of a music which is debilitated and
failing and a glorious, all-conquering science is what really
characterizes the 20th century condition.

What did I try to do, in this context, in 1948? As Boulez said,
extremely snidely (he's a pretentious boy, a kind of musical
Stalinist... I'm an anarchist myself), it was a case of
'bricolage'. (Note: This French noun has no direct equivalent in
English, but is close to the adjective 'makeshift'; and the idea of
improvising new uses for things originally meant for something else) I
retain this term not as an insult but as something very
interesting. After all, how did music originate? Through bricolage,
with calabashes, with fibres, as in Africa. (I'm familiar with African
instruments). Then people made violin strings out of the intestines of
cats. And of course the tempered scale is a compromise and also a
bricolage. And this bricolage, which is the development of music, is a
process that is shaped by the human, the human ear, and not the
machine, the mathematical system.

TH: It seems to me that there are several possible attitudes to the
machine. There is something which we can trace to a kind of puritan
tradition, where the machine represents a kind of purification, or
perfection, which we in ourselves cannot achieve, and is therefore an
escape from the human. Then there is another point of view which
retains a humanist perspective and sometimes a kind of projection of
human qualities onto the machine, and which is in any case a more
complex and a more doubting relationship... I would place the
Futurists, for example, in this second point of view. Looking at the
history of Musique Concrete, there sometimes seems to be a symmetry,
with sound on one side and system on the other, with Musique Concrete
taking the side of sound. Within this duality, would you agree that
Musique Concrete embodies a more humanist position?

PS: Yes, of course. You mention symmetry, and I would like to take
this term as a very good way of looking at this. But what symmetry? I
think we are speaking of a symmetry between the sound world and the
music world. The sound world is natural -- in the sense where this
includes sound made by sound-producing instruments -- the Rumori
generators, Concrete, etc. -- the sound of the voice, the sounds of
nature, of wind and thunder, and so forth. So there is, within the
human ear, as it developed over millions of years, a great capacity
for hearing all this sound. Sound is the vocabulary of nature. When we
hear the wind, the wind says 'I'm blowing'. When we hear water, the
water says 'I'm running'... and so forth. Noises have generally been
thought of as indistinct, but this is not true. In the 17th century
people thought of noises as unpleasant -- but noises are as well
articulated as the words in a dictionary. Opposing this world of sound
is the world of music, the world of musical entities, of what I have
called 'musical objects'. These occur when sounds bear musical
value. Take a sound from whatever source, a note on a violin, a
scream, a moan, a creaking door, and there is always this symmetry
between the sound basis, which is complex and has numerous
characteristics which emerge through a process of comparison within
our perception. If you hear a door creak and a cat mew, you can start
to compare them -- perhaps by duration, or by pitch, or by
timbre. Thus, whilst we are used to hearing sounds by reference to
their instrumental causes, the sound-producing bodies, we are used to
hearing musical sounds for their musical value. We give the same value
to sounds emanating from quite different sources. So the process of
compaaring a cat's mew to a door creak is different from the process
of comparing a violin note to a trumpet note, where you might say they
have the same pitch and duration but different timbre. This is the
symmetry between the world of sound and the world of musical values.

TH: What is musical value for you exactly?

PS: The best analogy is with language -- since we talk of musical
languages. People who share the same language, French or Chinese or
whatever, have the same vocal cords and emit sounds which are
basically the same, as they come from the same throats and lungs. So
this is a sound world. But the same sounds have linguistic values and
this makes them different. These linguistic values derive from their
role within a system. In the same way, musical value is inseparable
from the idea of system.

But how does this bear on the question of the machine in our
contemporary world -- which is really a different question from the
question of symmetry? We could say that the machine has had two quite
different, even antagonistic, impacts on our modern world. There is
the romantic, romanesque, illusionist tendency which proposes a
biology of the machine, which is rather what the Italians (Futurists)
were about; it goes back to the storms and the murmuring forests of
romanticism, the pastoral symphony, the representation of nature in
music. But of course as machines now constitute nature, music now
needs machines to represent this nature; our forests and countrysides
_are_ machines... But there is another, quite opposite, tendency,
which sees machines as the means not only of producing sound but also
of musical values themselves. Many researchers, well understanding the
pre-eminent importance of musical value, turned to the
physicists. Their values were now frequencies, decibles, harmonic
spectra. With electronics they could get direct access to all this and
have really precise and objective musical values. But then -- another
symmetry, this time a really disturbing one. When you build a farcical
machine for rumori with things rubbing against each other -- like the
Italians -- lead shot in a d rum, etc, you don't hurt a fly, it lasts
10, 20 years -- it's circus, quite harmless little sound effects. But
when you stick generations of young musicians, as is happening today,
in front of synthesisers -- I don't mean the ones for commercial
music, but the really precise ones, where you have one control for the
frequency, another for the decibels, another for the harmonic spectrum
-- then you're really in the shit... [Laughter]

TH: What then should one want to do with music? Accepting the need for
musical values is one thing, but how do you choose?

PS: You have to remind musicians of what Dante wrote over the Gates of
Hell: Abandon hope all ye who enter here...

TH: But if you stay outside?

PS: Well then you don't have any music. If you enter, if you want to
make music, you must abandon hope. Of what? Of making a new music.

TH: So new music is impossible?

PS: Yes, a music which is new because it comes from new instruments,
new theories, new languages. So what's left? Baroque music. Has it
struck you that the music which is regarded as the most sublime in
western civilization, which is the music of Bach, is called baroque?
(Note: In the French language, the term 'baroque' has the meaning
'roughly put together' -- as well as the meaning we have in English of
that theatrical, excessive, late Renaissance style.) Bizarre. Even its
contemporaries called it baroque. Bach lived in a moment of synthesis,
in terms of the instruments, the theory -- tempered scale, etc. -- and
was putting everything together. He was taking from the middle ages,
from the new developments in the instruments of his time, from the
Italians, and he made a music which was so clearly made up of bits and
pieces that it called itself baroque. Simultaneously traditional and
new. And this applies today; it will be when our contemporary
researchers abandon their ludicrous technologies and systems and 'new'
musical languages and realize that there's no way out of traditional
music, that we can get down to a baroque music for the 21st century.

Such a music has been prefigured in popular music - not that I rate it
very highly. Jazz, rock, etc, the music of 'mass' culture, and I'm not
talking about good jazz, the marvelous negro spirituals which are
completely traditional, but the kind of utility-music which is widely
used for dancing, making love, etc; this is a baroque music, a mixture
of electricity and DoReMi...

TH: So there is nothing essentially relevant in the fact that the
world we live in is changing and that we might need to express new or
different things about it?

PS: The answer is that the world doesn't change.

TH: There is no progress?

PS: There is no progress. The world changes materially. Science makes
advances in technology and understanding. But the world of humanity
doesn't change. Morally, the world is both better and worse than it
was. We are worse off than in the middle ages, or the 17th and 18th
centuries, in that we have the atomic menace. It's ridiculous that
time and time again we need a radioactive cloud coming out of a
nuclear power-station to remind us that atomic energy is
extraordinarily dangerous. So this shows the imbecility, the stupidity
of mankind. Why should a civilization which so misuses its power have,
or deserve, a normal music?

TH: Well, if you are committed to music, you try to reach, to
encourage, the good in people, whatever that is...

PS: That could be wishful thinking. I'll bring in Levi-Strauss, who
has said again and again that it's only things that change; the
structures, the structures of humanity, stay the same - and the uses
we make of these things. On this level we are just like the caveman
who makes a tool out of a flint, a tool for survival, but also a
deadly weapon: we haven't changed at all. The world has just got more
dangerous because the things we use have got more dangerous. In music
there are new things, synthesisers, taperecorders, etc., but we still
have our sensibilities, our ears, the old harmonic structures in our
heads we're still born in DoReMi - it's not up to us to
decide. Probably the only variations are ethnological. There are the
different musical cultures, the music of ancient Greece, for example,
in so far as we can know it, the music coming from the Hebrews into
the Gregorian chant, the music of India, China, Africa, these are the
variations, and it's all DoReMi...

TH: Are you pessimistic about the future of this variation - in the
sense that there is a cultural imperialism which is destroying the
local musics of the world and replacing them by a kind of central
music which is driven forward by industrial and political power?

PS: I'm very aware of what you're talking about as I was involved with
the radio in Africa in the same period as I was doing Concrete - I was
doing both at the same time. I was deeply afraid that these vulnerable
musical cultures, - lacking notation, recording, cataloging, and with
the approximative nature of their instruments - would be lost. I and
my colleagues were beginning to collect African music. At the radio
there is a small department run by Mr Toureille, who has very
courageously for 17 years systematically sent out expeditions to
gather authentic African musics and released them on record.

TH: The problem is that the records are bought in Europe and not in
Africa. It's hard to see how you can regenerate the music in its own
context. In fact, we can accuse ourselves of appropriating it. There
is this ambiguity in that we are in a meta-cultural position with the
entire cultural geography and history of the world laid out for our
pleasure. Do you think this situation brings about a lack of a sense
of the real value of culture and cultural artifacts? Many people
listen to ethnic musics from all over the place. Does this leaping
about in space and time affect the quality of the listening?

PS: Well I don't think we can answer this question of value
ultimately, but we can recognize the fact that civilizations are
mortal. In music there are, unfortunately, two principles at
work. There's the principle of barbarity. The fact that western
civilization invaded these autochthonous people entwined with their
ancient local cultures - this was certainly barbarous, if not entirely
heedless. Barbarians always think of themselves as the bringers of
civilization. The western barbarity was turntables, the radio, etc.

Then there's the principle of economics which is that bad money gets
thrown after good. So if barbarity is the triumph of force, bad money
is the triumph of economy - in a metaphoric sense...

TH: I'd like to turn now to the idea that, scattered all over the
world, probably in tiny garrets rather than in expensive
state-of-the-art studios, there are people busily cutting up bits of
tape, making loops, experimenting with tape-recorders, and I would
like to ask you if you have anything you would specially want to say
to these people.

PS: Well, first I can't pass the buck to them. I started all that. I
think they have the great satisfaction of discovering the world of
sound. The world of music is probably contained within DoReMi, yes;
but I'm saying that the world of sound is much larger than that. Let's
take a spatial analogy. Painters and sculptors are concerned with
spaces, volumes, colours, etc, but not with language. That's the
writer's concern. The same thing is true with sound. Musique Concrete
in its work of assembling sound, produces sound-works,
sound-structures, but not music. We have to not call music things
which are simply sound-structures...

TH: Is it not enough for a sound-work to have system, for it to become
music?

PS: The whole problem of the sound-work is distancing oneself from the
dramatic. I hear a bird sing, I hear a door creak, I hear the sounds
of battle; you start to get away from that. You find a neutral
zone. Just as a painter or sculptor moves away from a model, stops
representing a horse, or a wounded warrior, and arrives at the
abstract. A beautiful sculptural form, as beautiful as an egg, a
greenhouse, a star. And if you continue this abstracting movement, you
get to the graphics of the forms of letters in written
language. And-in music you get to music. There's thus a gradation
between the domain of raw sound, which starts by being imitative, like
the representational plastic arts, and the domain of
language. Between, there's a zone of gradation which is the area of
'abstract' in the plastic arts, and which is neither language nor
model, but a play of forms and materials.

There are many people working with sound. It's often boring, but not
necessarily ugly. It contains dynamic and kinaesthetic
impressions. But it's not music.

TH: But what is the exact moment at which something becomes music?

PS: This is a difficult question. If you had the complete answer you'd
be a prophet. The traditional testimony is that a musical schema lent
itself to being expressed in sound in more than one way. An example is
that Bach sometimes composed without specifying the instruments: he
wasn't interested in the sound of his music. That's music, a schema
capable of several realisations in sound. The moment at which music
reveals its true nature is contained in the ancient exercise of the
theme with variations. The complete mystery of music is explained
right there. Thus a second. a third a fourth variation were possible,
which all kept the single idea of the theme. This is the evidence that
with one musical idea you can have different realisations.

TH: Do you listen to rock music?

PS: My 18-year-old daughter listens a lot downstairs, so I hear what
comes under her door. It's enough.

TH: I was thinking that rock music is also a music that's essentially
engaged with technologies, in the sense that it grew up with the
recording technology and the means of mass-producing discs.

PS: What strikes me is the violence of the sound, a violence which
seems to be designed to reach not only the ear but also the gut. In a
certain way this seems to function as a drug. Real music is a sublime
drug, but you can't really call it a drug because it doesn't
brutalise, it elevates. These two characteristics of rock, the
violence of the sound and the drug-function, revolve on the basis of a
musical formula which is impoverished. This doesn't interest me. I
feel rather that it indicates a nostalgia amongst today's young
people, a desire to revert to savagery, to recover the primitive. At
this time, who can blame them? The primitive is also a source of
life. But the musical means seem sad and rather morbid. It's a
dishonest primitive because it's reached through technological
sophistication. It's a cheat.

TH: But do you recognize in it the techniques of Concrete, for example
in the idea of production, as the term is used in the recording
industry, this conceptualization of the difference between sound
source and process, between source and manipulation - where the
producer can regard the recorded sound as simply raw material for a
process of radical transformation, but of course, more often than not,
with the aim of making a successful commodity? Would you allow any
kind of humanist potential where the empiricism, the bricolage of
rock, is not totally subordinated to commerce?

PS: Well we've already mentioned pessimism, and I must say that I do
judge these times to be bad times. We seem to be afflicted by
ideologies - often, entirely incompatible ones. Thus, the ideology of
scientific rigour and at the same time the ideology of chance;
ideologies of power, technology, improvisation, facility -technology
with which to replace inspiration. If I compare that to jazz for
example in its historically fecund period, the extraordinary fruition
of American music at the point where the European DoReMi was suddenly
seized upon by the blacks for the production of expressive
forms... this was sublime. Now if you think that, decades later, this
bloated, avaricious and barbarous culture, brutalised by money and
machines and advertising, is still living off this precious
vein... well, you have to admit that some periods are simply vile,
disgusting, and that this is one of them. The only hope is that our
civilization will collapse at a certain point, as always happens in
history. Then, out of barbarity, a renaissance.

TH: Some of what you were saying about rock music reminded me of
Adorno's essay on jazz, the regressive, nostalgic function, and so
forth. Yet you find jazz, in its great period, sublime.

PS: But primitive American jazz was very rich, it wasn't very learned,
but it was richly inventive, in ways of expressing into sound, in its
voicings; what I really admired, when I was there the first time,
after the liberation, in the '50s, were the operettas - Carmen Jones,
excellent music, I can't remember the titles, but great music -
Gershwin of course...

TH: I have the impression that in the '40s and '50s you were
optimistic about the outcomes of your musical project. Was there a
particular moment when you underwent a general change in your
relationship to this project?

PS: I must say honestly that this is the most important question you
have asked me. I fought like a demon throughout all the years of
discovery and exploration in Musique Concrete; I fought against
electronic music, which was another approach, a systemic approach,
when I preferred an experimental approach actually working directly,
empirically with sound. But at the same time, as I defended the music
I was working on, I was personally horrified at what I was doing. I
felt extremely guilty. As my father, the violinist, used to say,
indulgently, What are you up to, my little chap? When are you going to
make music? And I used to say - I'm doing what I can, but I can't do
that. I was always deeply unhappy at what I was doing. I was happy at
overcoming great difficulties - my first difficulties with the
turntables when I was working on 'Symphonie pour un homme seul':: - my
first difficulties with the tape-recorders when I was doing 'Etude aux
objets' - that was good work, I did what I set out to do - my work on
the 'Solfege' - it's not that I disown everything I did - it was a lot
of hard work. But each time I was to experience the disappointment of
not arriving at music. I couldn't get to music - what I call music. I
think of myself as an explorer struggling to find a way through in the
far north, but I wasn't finding a way through.

TH: So you did discover that there was no way through.

PS: There is no way through. The way through is behind us.

TH: So it's in that context that we should understand your relatively
small output as a composer after those early years?

PS: I was very well received. I had no social problems. These
successes added to my burden of doubt. I'm the opposite of the
persecuted musician. In fact I don't consider myself a real
musician. I'm in the dictionary as a musician. It makes me laugh. A
good researcher is what I am.

TH: Did your time in Africa have any particular relevance to changes
in your attitudes to music?

PS: No. I had always been very interested in music from Asia, Africa,
America. I considered that music should be tracked down over the whole
surface of the planet.

TH: I think we've said enough.

PS: Yes, I think we've said a lot.
