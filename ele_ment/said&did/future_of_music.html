      <i>Perhaps the single most influential of Cage's written texts, this was 
      first delivered as a lecture in 1937 in Seattle, but not published until 
      1958 in the brochure accompanying George Avakian's recording of Cage's 25-Year

      <b>THE FUTURE OF MUSIC: CREDO</b><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I BELIEVE THAT THE USE OF NOISE<br>
      <br>
      Wherever we are, what we hear is mostly noise. When we ignore it, it disturbs 
      us. When we listen to it, we find it fascinating. The sound of a truck at 
      50 m.p.h. Static between the stations. Rain. We want to capture and control 
      these sounds, to use them, not as sound effects, but as musical instruments. 
      Every film studio has a library of "sound effects" recorded on film. With 
      a film phonograph it is now possible to control the amplitude and frequency 
      of any one of these sounds and to give to it rhythms within or beyond the 
      reach of anyone's imagination. Given four film phonographs, we can compose 
      and perform a quartet for explosive motor, wind, heartbeat, and landslide.<br>
      <br>
      TO MAKE MUSIC<br>
      <br>
      If this word, music, is sacred and reserved for eighteenth- and nineteenth-century 
      instruments, we can substitute a more meaningful term: organization of sound.<br>
      <br>
      WILL CONTINUE AND INCREASE UNTIL WE REACH A MUSIC PRODUCED THROUGH THE AID 
      OF ELECTRICAL INSTRUMENTS<br>
      <br>
      Most inventors of electrical musical instruments have attempted to imitate 
      eighteenth- and nineteenth-century instruments, just as early automobile 
      designers copied the carriage. The Novachord and the Solovox are examples 
      of this desire to imitate the past rather than construct the future. When 
      Theremin provided an instrument with genuinely new possibilities, Thereministes 
      did their utmost to make the instrument sound like some old instrument, 
      giving it a sickeningly sweet vibrato, and performing upon it, with difficulty, 
      masterpieces from the past. Although the instrument is capable of a wide 
      variety of sound qualities, obtained by the mere turning of a dial, Thereministes 
      act as censors, giving the public those sounds they think the public will 
      like. We are shielded from new sound experiences.<br>
      <br>
      The special property of electrical instruments will be to provide complete 
      control of the overtone structure of tones (as opposed to noises) and to 
      make these tones available in any frequency, amplitude, and duration.<br>
      <br>
      WHICH WILL MAKE AVAILABLE FOR MUSICAL PURPOSES ANY AND ALL SOUNDS THAT CAN 
      BE HEARD. PHOTOELECTRIC, FILM, AND MECHANICAL MEDIUMS FOR THE SYNTHETIC 
      PRODUCTION OF MUSIC<br>
      <br>
      It is now possible for composers to make music directly, without the assistance 
      of intermediary performers. Any design repeated often enough on a sound 
      track is audible. 280 circles per second on a sound track will produce one 
      sound, whereas a portrait of Beethoven repeated 50 times per second on a 
      sound track will have not only a different pitch but a different sound quality.<br>
      <br>
      WILL BE EXPLORED. WHEREAS, IN THE PAST, THE POINT OF DISAGREEMENT HAS BEEN 
      BETWEEN DISSONANCE AND CONSONANCE, IT WILL BE, IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, 
      BETWEEN NOISE AND SO-CALLED MUSICAL SOUNDS.<br>
      <br>
      THE PRESENT METHODS OF WRITING MUSIC, PRINCIPALLY THOSE WHICH EMPLOY HARMONY 
      AND ITS REFERENCE TO PARTICULAR STEPS IN THE FIELD OF SOUND, WILL BE INADEQUATE 
      FOR THE COMPOSER WHO WILL BE FACED WITH THE ENTIRE FIELD OF SOUND.<br>
      <br>
      The composer (organizer of sound) will not only be faced with the entire 
      field of sound but also with the entire field of time. The "frame" or fraction 
      of a second, following established film technique, will probably be the 
      basic unit in the measurement of time. No rhythm will be beyond the composer's 
      reach.<br>
      <br>
      NEW METHODS WILL BE DISCOVERED, BEARING A DEFINITE RELATION TO SCHOENBERG'S 
      TWELVE-TONE SYSTEM<br>
      <br>
      Schoenberg's method assigns to each material, in a group of equal materials, 
      its function with respect to the group. (Harmony assigned to each material, 
      in a group of unequal materials, its function with respect to the fundamental 
      or most important material in the group.) Schoenberg's method is analagous 
      to modern society, in which the emphasis is on the group and the integration 
      of the individual in the group.<br>
      <br>
      AND PRESENT METHODS OF WRITING PERCUSSION MUSIC<br>
      <br>
      Percussion music is a contemporary transition from keyboardinfluenced music 
      to the all-sound music of the future. Any sound is acceptable to the composer 
      of percussion music; he explores the academically forbidden "nonmusical" 
      field of sound insofar as is manually possible.<br>
      <br>
      Methods of writing percussion music have as their goal the rhythmic structure 
      of a composition. As soon as these methods are crystallized into one or 
      several widely accepted methods, the means will exist for group improvisations 
      of unwritten but culturally important music. This has already taken place 
      in Oriental cultures and in hot jazz.<br>
      <br>
      AND ANY OTHER METHODS WHICH ARE FREE FROM THE CONCEPT OF A FUNDAMENTAL TONE. 
      <br>
      <br>
      THE PRINCIPLE OF FORM WILL BE OUR ONLY CONSTANT CONNECTION WITH THE PAST. 
      ALTHOUGH THE GREAT FORM OF THE FUTURE WILL NOT BE AS IT WAS IN THE PAST, 
      AT ONE TIME THE FUGUE AND AT ANOTHER THE SONATA, IT WILL BE RELATED TO THESE 
      AS THEY ARE TO EACH OTHER<br>
      <br>
      Before this happens, centers of experimental music must be established. 
      In these centers, the new materials, oscillators, generators, means for 
      amplifying small sounds, film phonographs, etc., available for use. Composers 
      at work using twentieth-century means for making music. Performances of 
      results. Organization of sound for musical and extramusical purposes (theater, 
      dance, film).<br>
      <br>
      THROUGH THE PRINCIPLE OF ORGANIZATION OR MAN'S COMMON ABILITY TO THINK.
