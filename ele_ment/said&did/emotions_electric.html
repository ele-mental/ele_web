      "The Techno Rebels are, whether they recognise it or not, agents of the 
      Third Wave. They will not vanish but multiply in the years ahead. For they 
      are as much a part of the advance to a new stage of civilisation as our 
      missions to Venus, our amazing computers, our biological discoveries, or 
      our explorations of the oceanic depths." <i>The Third Wave</i>, Alvin Toffler.<br>
      <br>
      "We're not really interested in tearing you up with the scratches and cuts 
      tonight. We're more interested in...educating you for the future..." Derrick 
      May, WJLB Radio Mix<br>
      <br>
      It's 3am and the streets of America's seventh city are deserted as Derrick 
      May pilots his car through a crumbling monument to the Second Wave - the 
      age of industry and mass production - the age of Ford and Gordy who both 
      ran their second wave empires from here. "This place is fucked man. It's 
      finished," he says shaking his head incredulously. We pass a gutted building 
      filled with holes that were once windows. Detroit is winding down the past 
      and isn't sure if it wants to be part of the future.<br>
      <br>
      Driving down Woodward Avenue, we pass the wooden house that was home to 
      the carefully-honed pop soul of Motown. Motown was the musical backdrop 
      to the Second Wave. Motown means nothing to Derrick May.<br>
      <br>
      Via systems dance records like 'Nude Photo' and together with fellow artists 
      Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson, Derrick has invested his time, money and 
      energy in the future.<br>
      <br>
      Detroit rolls by like a discarded set from Robocop, a film set in the city's 
      fictional future. "Now you understand why we make this music," he says, 
      "We can do nothing but look forward..."<br>
      <br>
      Alvin Toffler's book is a kind of bible to Detroit's new musical revolutionaries. 
      This future shock manifesto sees the Third Wave technological future not 
      as a cocktail of 1984 Numanoid nightmares and Robocop lawlessness, but as 
      a place where man still controls. The nightmare of a brave new world where 
      machines and robots call the shots has no place in this book. Alvin Toffler, 
      like Kraftwerk, is not afraid of the pocket calculator and if he knew of 
      them, it's likely the academic would approve of Model 500, Rhythim Is Rhythim 
      and their positive futurism.<br>
      <br>
      The music they both make is not afraid of the future and the view they project 
      is as complex, as contradictory and as plausible as the world of Ridley 
      Scott's Blade Runner. Detroit's electronic music community don't fear the 
      robot. Unlike Gary Numan they look forward.<br>
      <br>
      And unlike the ironic acid casualties of Chicago or the scratch fanatics 
      of New York, they have no interest in old records, or scratch science. They 
      are the Techno Rebels-musical agents of the Third Wave who see the fusion 
      of man and machine as the only future.<br>
      <br>
      If Alvin Toffler hadn't learned to use a word processor, it's likely that 
      he would be connecting sequencer to drum machine and releasing records on 
      Metroplex, KMS or Transmat, three of Detroit's most active dance labels.<br>
      <br>
      Names like Metroplex and Transmat are now bywords for a sound which has 
      hi-jacked dancefloors across the world and diverted the spotlight from Chicago 
      - despite the fact that Detroit's new age electro sound has only a tenuous 
      connection with House. Only House clubs and DJs are open-minded enough to 
      deal with a hi-tech sound which can find no other home. Like House, it is 
      a machine-driven dance music. And like House it has an idealised notion 
      of Europe and European electronic music borne of a love for Kraftwerk.<br>
      <br>
      But despite American dance music's long standing obsession with Europe - 
      from the Munich Machine and Italian Disco to the popularity of records from 
      artists like Telex and Klein And MBO - the new music of Detroit is the first 
      to truly incorporate the European sound - a mixture of technology, detachment 
      and neo-classicism (mirrored in the synthetic strings of Rhythim is Rhythim) 
      so that it seems like something more than a strange metal leg on the wrong 
      body.<br>
      <br>
      From D Train and The System to Bambaata and Arthur Baker, this obsession 
      has plotted its way through US clubland. Every US producer shocked by the 
      starkness of Kraftwerk has since dreamed of Europe and the Trans-Europe 
      Express.<br>
      <br>
      The reasons why the most vibrant musical community in the world should want 
      to embrace Ralf and Florian's Robo pop are unclear. European music isn't 
      intrinsically better than the sound of America. In most cases it is uncategorically 
      inferior. "Perhaps I have an idealised image of Europe and its music," says 
      Derrick May. "I have a certain way I see it in my mind. I feel I should 
      be there, I know I'd feel right there."<br>
      <br>
      Techno is the sound of America's final and complete assimilation of the 
      European sound and the climax of a fascination. On Bambaata's brave 'Planet 
      Rock' the joins are not hard to find. Model 500's 'Techno Music' is flawless 
      Eurobeat which draws on its influences without tracing over them, Juan Atkins 
      floats somewhere over Dusseldorf and an integration process which has taken 
      almost ten years is complete.<br>
      <br>
      In this sense Detroit's new music is not a break with the black tradition 
      (it's acknowledgement of the influence of the Parliament/Funkadelic axis; 
      the futuristic funkiness of most of its output and Mayday's hissing hi-hat 
      patterns bear this out) but more importantly, the point at which America 
      has successfully integrated the European idea that sparked the experiment 
      that was electro.<br>
      <br>
      Patrick Cowley's Hi-Energy Sylvester productions of the early '80s show 
      the roots of black music's fascination with continental electronics. The 
      direct descendants of that sound are the Deep House records made in Chicago 
      - a crossbreed of gospel influenced vocals and hard synthesised trax. Detroit 
      goes one step further.<br>
      <br>
      Records like Blake Baxter's 'When We Used To Play' or Reese and Santonio's 
      'Rock To The Beat' only use the human voice out of context so it's strangeness 
      is exaggerated and its coldness becomes somehow machine-like.<br>
      <br>
      These sounds are as sublime, as ridiculous, as effective and as European 
      as Kraftwerk intoning 'Showroom Dummies' or New Order coldly inquiring, 
      "How does it feel?"<br>
      <br>
      The traditional understanding of black music and the accepted concept of 
      soul become useless. Techno, black music with a soul which refers rather 
      to the passionate commitment of its protagonists, has upturned these things 
      in a way that House with its allegiance to the Philly Sound never could. 
      Detroit has declared itself a satellite state of Germany.<br>
      <br>
      The roots of The Sound, can be traced back to Alvin Tofller's book, first 
      published in 1980 and a Vietnam veteran called Richard Davies who Derrick 
      May describes as, "unique and extremely intelligent".<br>
      <br>
      Juan Atkins met Richard Davies at Washtehaw Community College, Michigan. 
      Juan was already making primitive electro records limited by the equipment 
      available. Davies who is also known as 3070 (a futuristic name he devised 
      for himself) introduced Juan to the book and the concept of Techno.<br>
      <br>
      Together they formed Cybotron, a seminal Third Wave pop group whose first 
      record 'Alley's Of Your Mind' on the Deep Space label went on to sell 15,000 
      copies. 3070's futurism spread as Juan introduced him to Kevin Saunderson 
      and Derrick May - old friends from Bellville High School who were DJ-ing 
      in the city while dabbling with synthesisers inspired by Juan's home recorded 
      tracks.<br>
      <br>
      This was 1981, a time when the world outside would only deal with Cybotron 
      in terms of New York's electro scene - hence the appearance of the group's 
      fourth release, 'Techno City' on an early electro compilation. An album 
      'Enter' made clear that Cybotron came too soon to be fully understood, 3070 
      disappeared ultimately "fucked up" by his tour of duty in Vietnam and Juan 
      went on to work as Model 500 releasing records on his own Metroplex label.<br>
      <br>
      Eddie Fowlkes refers to him as 'Godfather Techno' though Juan, a thoughtful 
      figurehead, seems thoroughly embarrassed by the title. The Techno tag doesn't 
      fit all Detroit's Third Wave musicians as neatly as it fits Juan. His is 
      the purest Techno sound despite the inclusion of sinister whispered vocals, 
      drawing most obviously on European influences. 'No UF0s', an underground 
      dance classic since its release in 1985, is perhaps the scene's most important 
      record.<br>
      <br>
      "Detroit has always been a little strange", says Juan. "In Chicago, the 
      House sound is based largely on the music of Philly International. Detroit 
      never really took to disco. We were always more interested in European music 
      and funk has always been popular."<br>
      <br>
      This is borne out in the DOR (Dance Orientated Rock) clubs where Blake Baxter 
      used to DJ. The European fascination is intense with records by Depeche 
      Mode, Nitzer Ebb, Bauhaus and New Order easily the most requested. The Funk 
      finds its focus in the fact that most of the Parliament/Funkadelic/Bootsy 
      records of the late '70s were recorded at 'The P Funk Lab' of Detroit's 
      United Sound Studio on Second Avenue in central Detroit. Juan describes 
      Clinton's keyboard genius Bernie Worrell as, "the real Godfather of Techno.'<br>
      <br>
      Eddie Fowlkes, who now records with Juan at Metroplex studios and whose 
      1986 release "Goodbye Kiss" is one of the scene's most sought after records 
      elaborates; "The whole essence of Detroit is working class. The people are 
      working, working, to get to the top. Disco came in and it was soft but Clinton's 
      funk was hardcore and it suited the attitude of the people and the environment. 
      The origin of the hardness in Techno is funk."<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps it's the city's status as the murder capital of America that accounts 
      for that legacy of toughness "There is a lot of aggression in the music. 
      And despite what you might think the synthesises can be the most aggressive 
      instrument."<br>
      <br>
      "And you have to remember that this is Detroit," Eddie continues. "You could 
      be walking along the street and someone could wind down the window of a 
      car and shoot you. That tension, that sense of aggression is reflected in 
      the music."<br>
      <br>
      The past few years have brought at least 50 records from Detroit's Techno 
      innovators and it's a measure of the strength of the city's Third Wave that 
      the combinations of mixers, producers and editors are limitless. Kevin Saunderson 
      was born in New York and moved to Detroit as a child. Despite his friendship 
      with Derrick and Juan, only two years ago his mind was set on a career in 
      football. But as a DJ working college parties at East Michigan University, 
      he eventually got the bug. Now with his own label KMS, he is the scone's 
      most prolific creator, turning out seminal Techno like 'The Sound'.<br>
      <br>
      Blake Baxter, an offbeat vocal stylist with songs called 'Ride Em Boy' and 
      'Get Laid' is often compared to Chicago's Jamie Principle. But unlike Jamie, 
      he seems to have little time for the tension between sex and The Holy Sacraments. 
      And Blake has no time for self denial. "My music is about looking at things 
      in a sexual way, I like passionate things and I love sex. Sometimes I don't 
      think my songs go far enough. I wish they could be deeper but I'm not sure 
      if people are ready for that yet."<br>
      <br>
      On the American dance scene Derrick May is the best known producer of Techno 
      despite the fact that that Juan is the acknowledged originator. But Mayday 
      has taken Techno somewhere else and the term no longer describes accurately 
      what he does.<br>
      <br>
      His is a hard uncompromising sound and his commitment is intense. I mention 
      classic disco and he seizes the opportunity to talk about classical music. 
      Having just moved to a new house, Derrick tells me he can't make music there, 
      "I need a window, something to look at, something to think about." Driving 
      slowly around the city, he considers the impact his music has had. "It surprises 
      me. People always thought I was crazy to do it. Some people still do. Why 
      do people connect with my music? I think it's because the world has made 
      them bitter. They have deep emotional feelings and no way of expressing 
      them. I think the music brings those feelings out. They're out on the floor 
      dancing, but in their heads they see themselves walking on clouds or they 
      see themselves crossing that finishing line. My music makes me cry sometimes, 
      I think of things I was trying to express."<br>
      <br>
      "Sometimes I think about my grandfather, my mother, my childhood or my idols. 
      'Strings' was about Martin Luther King. When they killed him, they destroyed 
      the hopes and dreams of a generation. It was about the hope in his message."<br>
      <br>
      We drive to his old address, a flat on Second Avenue where all of the 110 
      tracks he has on disc were created. From a window on the top floor he talks 
      through the view that was the inspiration for his music.<br>
      <br>
      "I could work through the night and I would see the city waking up - the 
      face without the make-up. At night you would see the heat rising in the 
      air from the stacks of old factory buildings. Now, when I listen to those 
      tracks I see that view, I see the confusion of a city lost in transition 
      from one age to another. The city is dying but Juan and the rest of us are 
      all part of the third wave, the future."<br>
      <br>
      In the new music of Detroit the future is already here.<br>
