      While Frankie Knuckles had laid the groundwork for house at the Warehouse, 
      it was to be another DJ from the gay scene that was really to create the 
      environment for the house explosion - Ron Hardy. Where Knuckles' sound was 
      still very much based in disco, Hardy was the DJ that went for the rawest, 
      wildest rhythm tracks he could find and he made The Music Box the inspirational 
      temple for pretty much every DJ and producer that was to come out of the 
      Chicago scene. He was also the DJ to whom the producers took their very 
      latest tracks so they could test the reaction on the dance floor. Larry 
      Heard was one of those people. 
      <p> "People would bring their tracks on tape and the DJ would play spin 
        them in. It was part of the ritual, you'd take the tape and see the crowd 
        reaction. I never got the chance to take my own stuff because Robert (Owens) 
        would always get there first." 
      <p> "The Music Box was underground " remembers Adonis. "You could go there 
        in the middle of the winter and it'd be as hot as hell, people would be 
        walking around with their shirts off. Ron Hardy had so much power people 
        would be praising his name while he was playing, and I've got the tapes 
        to prove it! 
      <p> "The difference between Frankie and Ronnie was that people weren't making 
        records when Frankie was playing, though all the guys who would become 
        the next DJs were there checking him out. It was The Music Box that really 
        inspired people. I went there one night and the next day I was in the 
        studio making 'No Way Back' " In 1985 the records were few and far between. 
        By 1986 the trickle had turned to a flood and it seemed like everybody 
        in Chicago was making house music. The early players were joined by a 
        rush of new talent which included the first real vocal talents of house 
        - Liz Torres, Keith Nunally who worked with Steve Hurley, and Robert Owens 
        who joined up with Larry Heard to form Fingers Inc, though the duo had 
        already worked with Harri Dennis on The It's 'Donnie' -and key producers 
        like Adonis, Mr Lee, K Alexi and a guy who was developing a deep, melodic 
        sound that relied on big strings and pounding piano - Marshall Jefferson. 
      <p> Marshall worked with a number of people like Harri Dennis and Vince 
        Lawrence for projects like Jungle Wonz and Virgo, who made the stunning 
        'RU Hot Enough'. But it was 'Move Your Body' that became THE house record 
        of 1986, so big that both Trax and DJ International found a way to release 
        it, and it was no idle boast when the track was subtitled 'The House Music 
        Anthem', because that's exactly what it was. Jefferson was to become the 
        undisputed king of house, going on to make a string of brilliant records 
        with Hercules and On The House and developing the quintessential deep 
        house sound first with vocalist Curtis McClean and then with Ce Ce Rogers 
        and Ten City. "I can remember clearing a floor with that record" laughs 
        Jazzy M. "Though they'd started playing it in Manchester, most of London 
        was still caught up in that rare groove and hip hop thing. A lot of people 
        were saying to me 'why are you playing this hi- NRG' and it was hard work 
        but people were starting to get into it." 'Move Your Body' was undoubtedly 
        the record that really kicked off house in the UK, first played repeatedly 
        by the established pirate radio stations in London, which at the time 
        played right across the Black music spectrum, and then by club DJs like 
        Mike Pickering, Colin Faver, Eddie Richards, Mark Moore and Noel and Maurice 
        Watson, the latter two playing at the first club in London to really support 
        house - Delirium. 
      <p> Radio was the key to the explosion in Chicago. Farley Jackmaster Funk 
        had secured a spot on the adventurous WBMX station, playing after midnight 
        every day, and it wasn't long before he brought in the Hot Mix 5 which 
        included Mickey Oliver, Ralphie Rosario, Mario Diaz and Julian Perez, 
        and Steve Hurley, giving people who couldn't go to the parties the chance 
        to hear the music. Then there was Lil Louis, who was throwing his own 
        parties. By this time, house was moving out of the gay scene and on to 
        wider acceptance, though in Chicago at least it was to remain very much 
        a Black thing. Though a number of Hispanics were on the house scene, the 
        number of White DJs and producers could be counted on one hand. 
      <p> The labels were still mostly limited to the terrible twins that were 
        to dominate Chicago house for the next two years Trax and DJ International. 
        Between them they had nearly all the local talent sewn up and by popular 
        consent they were just as dodgy as each other, with rumors and stories 
        of rip-offs and generally dubious activity endlessly circulating. Everybody 
        it seemed, was stealing from everybody else. One that remains largely 
        untold involved Frankie Knuckles. "This was the story at the time" recalls 
        Adonis. "Supposedly Frankie sold Jamie Principle's unreleased tapes to 
        DJ International AND Trax at the same time. Then Jamie came out with a 
        record called 'Knucklehead' dissing Frankie. After that Frankie went back 
        to New York." 
      <p> When Rocky Jones at DJ International became convinced by a larger- than-life 
        character named Lewis Pitzele who was helping put a lot of the deals together 
        at the time that Europe was the place to focus on, house poured into Britain 
        with London Records putting the first compilation of early DJ International 
        material out. As the press bandwagon rolled into action the 86 Chicago 
        House Party featuring Adonis, Marshall Jefferson, Fingers Inc and Kevin 
        Irving toured the UK's clubs. Trax took a little longer 
      <p> Adonis: "Trax was meant to be a bullshit label for all the dirty, raggedy 
        records Larry Sherman didn't give a shit about. You know, labels were 
        always trying to do radio stuff, but Trax became popular after 'No Way 
        Back' and 'Move Your Body' and all those tracks." It was DJ International 
        and London who notched up the first house hits, first with Farley 'Jackmaster' 
        Funk's 'Love Can't Turn Around', a cover of the old Isaac Hayes song with 
        camp wailer Daryl Pandy on vocals which reached Number 10 in September 
        1986, and then a record that spent months gestating in the clubs before 
        it was finally catapulted to Number One in January 1987 - Jim Silk's 'Jack 
        Your Body'. The Americans were gob smacked. Their underground club music 
        was going mainstream four thousand miles from its home. But it was no 
        surprise that Steve Hurley was behind the track, which hit the top despite 
        only having three words - the title. Even then he was the one with the 
        commercial touch. It wasn't a terribly original record - the bassline 
        was from First Choice's 'Let No Man Put Asunder', but it summed up the 
        mood of jack fever. All of a sudden the word 'Jack', which originally 
        described the form of dancing people did to house, was everywhere 'Jack 
        The Box', 'Jack The House', 'Jack To The Sound' 'J-J-J-J-JJack-Jack-Jack-Jack'. 
        It was the stutter sample on the 'J' that took the word into legend. Vaughan 
        Mason's Raze, who'd quietly been doing stuff out of Washington DC burst 
        into the clubs and then followed Jim Silk into the charts with 'Jack The 
        Groove'. And garage? New York simply couldn't match the energy flowing 
        out of Chicago but there was little doubt that the music was developing 
        simultaneously. The Jersey garage sound, boosted by Tony Humphries (who'd 
        also been on the radio since 1981) at Newark's Zanzibar Club, was beginning 
        to take shape with Blaze but the New York club sound was defined at the 
        time by Dhar Braxton's 'Jump Back' and Hanson & Davis' 'Hungry For Your 
        Love' which borrowed heavily from the Latin freestyle sound but echoed 
        the energy of house. And over in Brooklyn, producers like Tommy Musto 
        working for the Underworld/Apexton label were developing a different style 
        again, one that like Chicago seemed to take its roots as much from Eurobeat 
        as from Black music, though the mood and tempo was strictly New York.
