      While Chicago stole the thunder in 1986, other cities not only in the United 
      States but across the world had either been absorbing house or working on 
      their own thing, biding their time. One record from New York served a warning 
      shot that the city was gearing up for some serious action - 'Do It Properly' 
      by 2 Puerto Ricans, A Blackman and A Dominican. 'Do It Properly' was essentially 
      a bootleg of Adonis' 'No Way Back' with loads of samples and a great electronic 
      keyboard riff squeezed in to it and the first in a long, long line of New 
      York sample house tracks. Its producers were one Robert Clivilles and David 
      Cole, helped by another guy called David Morales. After that some kid in 
      Brooklyn called Todd Terry made a couple of sample tracks with a freestyle 
      groove for Fourth Floor Records by an act he called Masters At Work. 
      <p> But the sound that was really taking shape in New York and New Jersey 
        was a deep style of club music based on a heritage that had its roots 
        firmly in r'n'b. Though there were some superb deep, emotive instrumentats 
        like Jump St. Man's 'B-Cause', the emphasis was on songs, which came with 
        Arnold Jarvis' 'Take Some Time', Touch's 'Without You', Exit's 'Let's 
        Work It Out' and a record on Movln, a new label run from a record store 
        in New Jersey's East Orange - Park Ave's 'Don't Turn Your Love'. Ironically, 
        as the first garage hits began to appear, The Paradise Garage - Larry 
        Levan had already left - closed, but the vibe carried on with Blaze, who 
        recorded 'If You Should Need A Friend' and Jomanda, both of whom teamed 
        up with new New York label Quark. 
      <p> Echoing the need for vocals in house music, deep house began to take 
        hold in Chicago. Following Marshall Jefferson's lush productions, the 
        record that defined deep house was the Nightwriters' 'Let The Music Use 
        You', mixed by Frankie Knuckles and sung by Ricky Dillard, a record that 
        a year later was to become one of the anthems of the UK's Summer Of Love. 
        And it didn't end there. Kym Mazelle launched her career with 'Taste My 
        Love' and 'I'm A Lover', while Ralphie Rosario unleashed the monstrous 
        'You Used To Hold Me' featuring the wailing tonsils of Xavier Gold. Then 
        there was Ragtyme's 'I Can't Stay Away', sung by a guy who sounded a a 
        little like a new Smokey Robinson - Byron Stingily. Soon after, Ragtyme, 
        who also made an extremely silly innuendo track called 'Mr Fixit Man', 
        mutated into Ten Clty. But Chicago's excursion into songs wasn't only 
        characterised by uplifting wailers. There was another side, led by the 
        weird, melanchoty songs of Fingers Inc and beginning to show itself in 
        other minimalist productions like MK II's 'Don't Stop The Muslc' and 2 
        House People's 'Move My Body'. By 1987, though house was no longer a tale 
        of two cities. The virus was taklng hold elsewhere as clubbers, DJs and 
        producers worldwide became exited by the new music. 
      <p> It was obvious that Britain, which had already seen a massive boom in 
        club culture in the mid-eighties as the increasingly racially integrated 
        urban areas turned to Black music in favour of the indigeonous indie rock 
        music, would eventually get in on the act. Though acts like Huddersfield's 
        Hotline, The Beatmasters from London and a handful of others who included 
        DJs Ian B and Eddie Richards had been trying to figure things out, the 
        first British house track to really make any noise came from a partnership 
        that included a DJ from Manchester's Hacienda, one of the very first clubs 
        in Britain to devote whole nights to house music - Mike Pickering. With 
        its funk bassline and Latin piano riffs, T-Coy's 'Carino' busted out all 
        over, particularly in London at previously rap and funk clubs like Raw. 
        But with the open nature of the UK pop charts compared to Billboard which 
        was an impossibly tough nut to crack for small labels marketing new music, 
        it was inevitable that the sound would be commercialised. 'Pump Up The 
        Volume' by M/A/R/R/S was a rather lightweight record based on a house 
        beat with a number of clever (at the time) samples but it worked like 
        crazy on the dancefloor and it wasn't long before club support propelled 
        it into the charts, where it held Number 1 for an incredible three weeks. 
        Also in the top ten at the same time was another record that had broken 
        out of Chicago - the House Master Boyz' 'House Nation'. The marketability 
        of house - or pophouse - in the UK became gruesomely apparent with the 
        advent of the 'Jack Mix' series, a number of hideous stars-on-45 style 
        megamixes of all the house hits. 
      <p> Things were progressing in a much more underground fashion back in the 
        States. A few guys in particular who'd been noticed hanging out in Chicago 
        and checking the scene came from a city just a couple of hundred miles 
        away Detroit. One of them, Juan Atkins, had been making records since 
        the early eighties under the moniker Cybotron which specialised in spacey 
        electro-funk fired by the Euro rhythms of Kraftwerk. But progress had 
        been slow and electro had already fused with rap. By 1985 Atkins' sound 
        was beginning to change with records like Model 500's 'No UFO's', which 
        bore more than a passing resemblance to the new sounds emanating from 
        their neighbouring city. Two other guys who had been to school with Atkins, 
        and who shared his passion for European music were also beginning to experiment 
        with making tracks and heartened by what they heard coming out of Chicago, 
        set to work Their first tracks, X-Ray's 'Let's Go', produced by Derrick 
        May and Kevin Saunderson's 'Triangle Of Love' by Kreem weren't classics 
        by any stretch of the imagination but it didn't tahe them long to hit 
        full power. Kevin came out with 'Force Field' and 'Just Want Another Chance', 
        and Juan pressed on with Model 500's 'Sound Of Stereo' but it was Derrick 
        who really hit the button with Rhythim Is Rhythm's 'Nude Photo', 'Kaos' 
        and 'The Dance', all of which were immediate hits on the Chicago scene, 
        and the latter a record that was to be thieved and sampled again and again 
        for years to come. The Belleville Three, as they became known after the 
        college they attended, made an amusing trio with Kevin as the regular 
        guy, Derrick as the fast-talking nutter and Juan as the laid-back smokehead, 
        but there was more to techno than that. Two other producers who helped 
        forge the different sound were Eddie Fowlkes and Blake Baxter. It was 
        faster, more frantic, even more influenced by European electrobeat and 
        severed the continium with disco and Philadelphia, taking only the space 
        funk basslines of George Ctinton from Black music. They called it techno. 
        But Chicago was also beginning to head off into another direction, the 
        most frenetic form of house yet. It was started by two crazy tracks that 
        Ron Hardy had been pumping at the Music Box and it was going to be perhaps 
        the most important stage of house so far. It was acid.
