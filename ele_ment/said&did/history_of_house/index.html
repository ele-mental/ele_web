      It's been ten years since the first identifiably house tracks were put on 
      to vinyl, ten years which have changed the technology behind the electronic 
      music revolution beyond recognition but left the basic structure of house 
      intact. It's seven years since it was being said house couldn't last, that 
      it was just hi-NRG, a fast blast that would wither as quickly as it had 
      started. But then the music reinvented itself, and then again and again 
      until it gradually dawned on people that house wasn't just another phase 
      of club culture, it was club culture, the continuing future of dance music. 
      The reason? It's simple. People like to dance to house.<br>
