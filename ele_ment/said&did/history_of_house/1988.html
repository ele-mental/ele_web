      In truth, acid house had already started long before 1988. Amongst the scores 
      of Chicagoans who were buying equipment and trying to learn how to make 
      tracks was one DJ Pierre, who'd started out playing Italian imports at roller 
      discos in the Chicago suburbs, and who had joined Lil Louis for his notorious 
      parties. 
      <p> "Phuture was me and two other guys, Spanky and Herbert J." remembers 
        Pierre. "We had this Roland 303, which was a bassline machine, and we 
        were trying to figure out how to use it. When we switched it on, that 
        acid sound was already in it and we liked the sound of it so we decided 
        to add some drums and make a track with it. We gave it to Ron Hardy who 
        started playing it straight away. In fact, the first time he played it, 
        he played it four times in one night! The first time people were like, 
        'what the fuck is this?' but by the the fourth they loved it. Then I started 
        to hear that Ron was playing some new thing they were calling 'Ron Hardy's 
        Acid Trax', and everybody thought it was something he'd made himself. 
        Eventually we found out that it was our track so we called it 'Acid Trax'. 
        I think we may have made it as early as 1985, but Ron was playing it for 
        a long time before it came out." 
      <p> Explanations for the name of 'acid' have been long and varied, but the 
        most popular, and the one endorsed by a number of people who were there 
        at the time was that they used to put acid in the water at the Music Box. 
        Pierre though, stresses that Phuture was always anti- drugs, and cites 
        a track about a cocaine nightmare, 'Your Only Friend' that was on the 
        same EP as 'Acid Trax'. 'Acid Trax' came out in 1986 but made little impact 
        outside Chicago, as was the case with another acid track, Sleazy D's 'I've 
        Lost Control', which slapped a deranged laugh and some geezer repeating 
        the title over the 303 squelching. 'I've Lost Control' was made by Adonis 
        and Marshall Jefferson and was certainly the first acid track to make 
        it to vinyl, though which was created first will possibly never be known 
        for sure. It wasn't until well into 1987 that the acid sound began to 
        infiltrate Britain, fuelled by another track that was getting a lot club 
        play, and which fitted into the sound Bam Bam's 'Give It To Me', and a 
        diversion of the regular acid track which put vocals into the equation, 
        developed by Pierre's Phantasy Club with 'Fantasy Girl'. The house scene 
        in Britain had faltered following the commercialisation of the poppier 
        end of the spectrum, but towards the end of 1987 the underground was taking 
        off with new LP compilation series like 'Jack Trax' and the opening in 
        London of seminal clubs like Shoom and Spectrum and the move of Delirium 
        to Heaven where the main dancefloor became exclusively house. Delirium's 
        Deep House Convention atLeicester Square's Empire in February 1988 which 
        featured a number of seminal Chicago artists like Kym Mazelle, Fingers 
        Inc, Xavier Gold. Marshall Jefferson and Frankie Knuckles was a depressing 
        event because of the poor turnout. But the people who did go were to be 
        become the prime movers of London's house explosion. The next week a warehouse 
        party called Hedonism was rammed and the soundtrack was acid. Acid house 
        UK style had begun. 
      <p> As acid tracks like Armando's '151' and 'Land Of Confusion', Bam Bam's 
        'Where's Your Child' and Adonis' 'The Poke' began to flow out out of Chicago, 
        the scene grew at a rate of knots with Rip, Love, Future, Contusion and 
        Trip opening in London, and the legendary Nude in Manchester. DJs suddenly 
        discovered they had a year's worth of classic house which hitherto they'd 
        been unable to play. When WBMX in Chicago closed down, signalling the 
        end of radio play for the music in the city, it was clear that the emphasis 
        had switched to the UK. Acid house became the biggest youth cult in Britain 
        since punk rock a decade before as British house records like Bang The 
        Party's 'Release Your Body', Jullan Jonah's 'Jealousy & Lies' (later used 
        as the backbone of Electrlbe 101's 'Talking With Myself'), Baby Ford's 
        'Oochy Koochy', A Guy Called Gerald's Voodoo Ray, and Richie Rich's 'Salsa 
        House' became huge club hits, before the chart UK house records emerged 
        with S'Express' 'Theme From S'Express', D-Mob's 'We Call It Acid', which 
        popularised the ridiculous but funny club chant of 'Aciiieeeeed!' and 
        Jolly Roger's 'Acid Man'. Opinions differ as to the effect on the scene 
        of the relatively new drug ecstasy, but there was little doubt that the 
        sudden rise in availabilny of the drug was directly related to the growth 
        of the club scene. Before the tabloids discovered what was going on with 
        their inevitably lurid headlines about 'Acid House Parties' and drug barons, 
        it was easy to see people openly imbibing the drug in any club. 
      <p> Like Chicago radio was to prove crucial to spreading house in Britain. 
        But this wasn't any kind of legitimate radio. Save for a few token shows, 
        you couldn't hear Black music or dance music on legal radio, and eventually 
        the demand turned into supply in the form of numerous pirate stations, 
        mostly in and around London but also in a few other big cities. Most of 
        them were on and off the air in months or even weeks, but the more organised 
        stations managed to keep going, supplying hungry listeners with the music 
        they wanted to hear - reggae, soul, jazz, hip hop - and house. Steve Jackson's 
        House That Jack Built on Kiss and Jazzy M's 'Jacking Zone' on LWR pumped 
        out the new music week in, week out. 
      <p> "When LWR was what you call the boom, it was on half a million listeners." 
        says Jazzy M. And we knew that because the surveys were actually being 
        published in newspapers The Jacking Zone was getting 40-50 letters a week 
        and I was broke because all my wages went on new tunes. Once that plane 
        had landed with the imports, I was getting the new records on the show 
        the same night. It was unbelievable." 
      <p> 1988 wasn't just acid it was the year that house first really began 
        to diversify. For a start, there was the 'Balearic' business, an eclectic 
        style of DJing which at the time encompassed dance mixes of pop artists 
        like Mandy Smith and quasi-industrial music like Nitzer Ebb's 'Join In 
        The Chant' Championed by Danny Rampling, Nicky Holloway, Paul Oakenfold 
        and Johnny Walker who'd all been to Ibiza, Balearic was an integral part 
        of the club scene at the time, but after the gushing media overkill it 
        all became a little farcical as people attempted to make Balearic records 
        There was, of course no such thing 
      <p> Then there were the anthems. A year's worth of inspirational Chicago 
        deep house, which went back to the Nightwriters and took in Joe Smooth's 
        'Promised Land' and Sterling Void's 'It's Alright' along the way became 
        some of the biggest club records of the year, while Marshall Jefferson 
        took the music to new highs with Ten City's 'Devotion' and Ce Ce Rogers 
        'Someday'. Marshall was on a roll in 88, picking up remixes and linking 
        up with Kym Mazelle for 'Useless' It was the deep house that spawned the 
        first two house LP's, which naturally came out in Britain first - Fingers 
        Inc's benchmark 'Another Side' and Liz Torres With Master C & J's excellent 
        'Can't Get Enough'. 
      <p> Ten City were an important stage in the development of house. With self-conviction 
        unusually high for the time, they snubbed the Chicago labels which by 
        that time were losing their artists more quickly than they could sign 
        them, and headed for Atlantic records in New York where Merlin Bobb promptly 
        snapped them up. Where nearly all the house that had gone before them 
        was strictly producer created, Ten City were an act, and they could be 
        marketed as such. Plus, they returned some of the soul vision to house, 
        a tradition that went all the way back to the Philly sound it was no coincidence 
        that 'Devotion' was one of the first records from Chicago to really do 
        well on the East Coast, which always had much stronger r'n'b roots in 
        its club music. After another huge club hit with 'Right Back To You', 
        they broached the UK top Ten in January 1989 with 'That's The Way Love 
        Is' Even Detroit was discovering songs. Though the new techno sound was 
        by now at full tilt with Rhythm Is Rhythm's anthem 'Strings 0f Life' Model 
        500's 'Off To Battle' and Reese & Santonio's 'Rock To The Beat', it was 
        Inner City's 'Big Fun' a techno song with vocals by Chicagoan Paris Grey 
        that was to propel Kevin Saunderson into the big time. Originally a track 
        recorded for Virgin's groundbreaking 'Techno! The New Dance Sound Of Detroit' 
        LP, 'Big Fun' was just too commercial to hold back, and Saunderson suddenly 
        found himself in a virtually full-time pop duo making videos, follow-up 
        singles and EPs like any other pop act. 
      <p> Chicago however was still finding new things to do with house, though 
        the next trend wasn't to be anything like as significant. There had already 
        been raps put down to house tracks as early as 1985 with 'Music Is The 
        Key' and more recently with M-Doc's 'It's Percussion', The Beatmasters' 
        'Rok Da House' and New York's KC Flight with 'Let's Get Jazzy'. But it 
        was Tyree Cooper (who'd already had a big club record with 'Acid Over') 
        and rapper Kool Rock Steady who defined the hip-house style with 'Turn 
        Up The Bass', a galloping track which somehow combined Kool's rap with 
        the classic Chicago piano sound and Tyree's trademark 909 roll. It wasn't 
        long before Fast Eddie, also at DJ International, expanded it with 'Yo 
        Yo Get Funky'. 
      <p> But the biggest new producer of 1988 was someone who didn't come from 
        Chicago at all. Or Detroit. New York was beginning to flex its muscles, 
        the city that had always regarded itself the world's capital for dance 
        music wanted some of the limelight back. But it wasn't an established 
        figure in the New York or New Jersey dance scene that broke through, it 
        was a kid from Brooklyn who was showing an incredible alacrity for the 
        new form of sampling that had been co- developing with house - Todd Terry. 
        First it was those Masters At Work tracks, but after that Todd hit house 
        in a big way with 'Bango' (at which Kevin Saunderson was highly miffed, 
        because it heavily sampled one of his records), 'Just Wanna Dance', Swan 
        Lake's 'In The Name Of Love', Black Riot's 'A Day In The Life' and 'Warlock' 
        and the one that was almost certainly the biggest club record of the year 
        - Royal House's 'Can You Party!'. Though in New York Todd's sample tracks 
        were firmly categorized with the Latin freestyle house sound that the 
        Hispanics were developing, in the UK Todd became the toast of the house 
        scene. In a by now familiar scenario, 'Can You Party' hit the Top 20 in 
        October on a wave of club support, closely followed by another track on 
        the new Big Beat label out of New York, Kraze's 'The Party'. 
      <p> As it became more and more apparent that Chicago was grinding to a halt, 
        New York was getting it together, with more labels like Cutting (who'd 
        already released Nitro Deluxe's classic 'Let's Get Brutal' in 1987) and 
        Warlock turning to house and new labels starting up. One of these was 
        to prove more important than all the rest - Nu Groove.
