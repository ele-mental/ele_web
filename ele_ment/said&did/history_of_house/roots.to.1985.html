      Like it or not, house was first and foremost a direct descendant of disco. 
      Disco had already been going for ten years when the first electronic drum 
      tracks began to appear out of Chicago, and in that time it had already suffered 
      the slings and arrows of merciless commercial exploitation, dilution and 
      racial and sexual prejudice which culminated in the 'disco sucks' campaign. 
      In one bizarrely extreme incident, people attending a baseball game in Chicago's 
      Komishi Park were invited to bring all their unwanted disco records and 
      after the game they were tossed onto a massive bonfire. Disco eventually 
      collapsed under a heaving weight of crass disco versions of pop records 
      and an ever-increasing volume of records that were simply no good. But the 
      underground scene had already stepped off and was beginning to develop a 
      new style that was deeper, rawer and more designed to make people dance. 
      Disco had already produced the first records to be aimed specifically at 
      DJs with extended 12" versions that included long percussion breaks for 
      mixing purposes and the early eighties proved a vital turning point. Sinnamon's 
      'Thanks To You', D-Train's 'You're The One For Me' and The Peech Boys' 'Don't 
      Make Me Wait', a record that's been continually sampled over the last decade, 
      took things in a different direction with their sparse, synthesized sounds 
      that introduced dub effects and drop-outs that had never been heard before. 
      <p> But it wasn't just American music laying the groundwork for house. European 
        music, spanning English electronic pop like Depeche Mode and Soft Cell 
        and the earlier, more disco based sounds of Giorgio Moroder, Klein & MBO 
        and a thousand Italian productions were immensely popular in urban areas 
        like New York and Chicago. One of the reasons for their popularity was 
        two clubs that had simultaneously broken the barriers of race and sexual 
        preference, two clubs that were to pass on into dance music legend - Chicago's 
        Warehouse and New York's Paradise Garage. Up until then, and after, the 
        norm was for Black, Hispanic, White, straight and gay to segregate themselves, 
        but with the Warehouse, opened in 1977 and presided over by Frankie Knuckles 
        and the Garage where Larry Levan spun, the emphasis was on the music. 
        (Ironically, Levan was first choice for the Warehouse, but he didn't want 
        to leave New York). And the music was as varied as the clienteles - r'n'b 
        based Black dance music and disco peppered with things as diverse as The 
        Clash's 'Magnificent Seven'. For most people, these were the places that 
        acted as breeding grounds for the music that eventually came to be known 
        after the clubs - house and garage. 
      <p> Right from the start there was a difference in approach between New 
        York and Chicago. "All of the records coming out of New York had been 
        either mid or down tempo, and the kids in Chicago wouldn't do that all 
        night long, they needed more energy" commented Frankie Knuckles after 
        his move to Chicago. The Windy City was seduced to a far greater extent 
        by the European sound and when the records started to come, it showed. 
        Whereas garage in New York evolved more smoothly from First Choice and 
        the labels Salsoul, West End and Prelude, there was no such evolution 
        in Chicago. Opinions still differ as to what the first house record was, 
        but it was certainly made by Jessie Saunders and it was on the Mitchball 
        label - probably Z Factor's 'Fantasy', but there was also another Z Factor 
        tune which went by the name of 'I Like To Do It In Fast Cars'. 'Fantasy' 
        sounds extremely dated now but ten years ago it was like a sound from 
        another planet, with echoes of Kraftwerk's heavily synthesized string 
        sounds, a Eurobeat bassline and a simple, insistent drum machine pattern. 
        Suffice to say, the record remained obscure outside the close-knit urban 
        Chicago scene. 
      <p> "Those records didn't really motivate people" says Adonis, one of the 
        early producers on the Chicago scene. "The first was Jamie Principle's 
        'Waiting On Your Angel'. See, before there were records there were cassettes, 
        and that was the hottest thing in Chicago. It was so hot Jessie Saunders 
        went in and recorded that track word for word, note for note, and put 
        it out on Larry Sherman's label Precision. It was so influential that 
        four or five records came out that took its sounds." Within a year though, 
        others were fast joining. Saunders, who by then had come out with his 
        Jes-Say label, with Farley Keith (or Farley 'Jackmaster' Funk) getting 
        in on the act. Frankie Knuckles, who had already done some remixes for 
        Salsoul was also beginning to work on his own productions. By 1985 it 
        was clear that something big was beginning to stir. Ron Hardy, who was 
        to become the backbone of the Chicago club scene by consistently breaking 
        the new records, began playing at The Music Box around the same time as 
        Frankie Knuckles left The Warehouse, and other DJs like Farley and the 
        Hot Mix 5 who threw down the mix shows on the radio station WBMX were 
        making names for themselves. But making a record wasn't the priority for 
        most of the DJs at the time - they were making music specifically to play 
        at the clubs and the parties that were beginning to spring up in the city. 
        Larry Heard and Robert Owens, later to be known as Fingers Inc, and Steve 
        Hurley were all experimenting with basic rhythm tracks long before they 
        made the jump to vinyl. 
      <p> "I started dabbling in making my own music." says Hurley. "Just making 
        tracks to play as a DJ, not really thinking as far as producing - more 
        to do with just having something to play that nobody else had. And one 
        of these tracks, 'Music Is The Key', got such a good response that I decided 
        to borrow some money and go in with another guy, who happened to be Rocky 
        Jones, and put the record out." 
      <p> That momentous occasion was the beginning of DJ International Records, 
        one of the two labels that was to give all the aspiring producers in the 
        city a chance to get their music on to vinyl. The other, Larry Sherman's 
        Trax Records was already up and running, though to begin with Sherman 
        was attempting to break into a more commercial market with Precision. 
        'Music Is The Key' (the first house record to include a rap, incidentally) 
        took house on a step by incorporating more musical elements and a vocal, 
        and by the time Chip E's 'Like This', also on DJ International, appeared 
        house had discovered real vocals and the sampled stutter technique that's 
        such an integral part of dub remixes today. "It took a little while for 
        the sound to develop" remembers London DJ Jazzy M, who worked in a record 
        shop at the time and was one of the very first to get house on the radio 
        in Britain with his immensely popular Jackin' Zone show on London pirate 
        station LWR. "When 'Like This' and Adonis' 'No Way Back' came out, that's 
        when it picked up. At first it was just drum machine programs and they 
        were called trax, like there was Chip E Trax and Kenny Jason Trax and 
        that's what house was, with maybe a few dodgy samples. I can remember 
        talking to Colin Faver, who was one of the first DJs here to get into 
        it, about 'Like This' and we were both really excited by it." 
      <p> Meanwhile, things were gathering pace over in New York though the development 
        was a lot slower. Mixers like Larry Levan, Tony Humphries, Timmy Regisford 
        and Boyd Jarvis, who came straight after Shep Pettibone and Jellybean 
        Benitez were making ground as remixers, and fired by the raw club sound 
        of Colonel Abrams, the deep, soulful club sound that became known as garage 
        was taking shape with early releases on the Supertonics, Easy Street and 
        Ace Beat labels. Paul Scott was one of the first with 'Off The Wall' in 
        1985 but before that there was Serious Intention's deep dub classic 'You 
        Don't Know' and even before that was World Premiere's 'Share The Night'.
