      <b>The Art of Noises</b><br>
      <br>
      Dear Balilla Pratella, great Futurist composer,<br>
      <br>
      In Rome, in the Costanzi Theatre, packed to capacity, while I was listening 
      to the orchestral performance of your overwhelming Futurist music, with 
      my Futurist friends, Marinetti, Boccioni, Carrà, Balla, Soffici, Papini 
      and Cavacchioli, a new art came into my mind which only you can create, 
      the Art of Noises, the logical consequence of your marvelous innovations.<br>
      <br>
      Ancient life was all silence. In the nineteenth century, with the invention 
      of the machine, Noise was born. Today, Noise triumphs and reigns supreme 
      over the sensibility of men. For many centuries life went by in silence, 
      or at most in muted tones. The strongest noises which interrupted this silence 
      were not intense or prolonged or varied. If we overlook such exceptional 
      movements as earthquakes, hurricanes, storms, avalanches and waterfalls, 
      nature is silent.<br>
      <br>
      Amidst this dearth of noises, the first sounds that man drew from a pieced 
      reed or streched string were regarded with amazement as new and marvelous 
      things. Primitive races attributed sound to the gods; it was considered 
      sacred and reserved for priests, who used it to enrich the mystery of their 
      rites.<br>
      <br>
      And so was born the concept of sound as a thing in itself, distinct and 
      independent of life, and the result was music, a fantastic world superimposed 
      on the real one, an inviolatable and sacred world. It is easy to understand 
      how such a concept of music resulted inevitable in the hindering of its 
      progress by comparison with the other arts. The Greeks themselves, with 
      their musical theories calculated mathematically by Pythagoras and according 
      to which only a few consonant intervals could be used, limited the field 
      of music considerably, rendering harmony, of which they were unaware, impossible.<br>
      <br>
      The Middle Ages, with the development and modification of the Greek tetrachordal 
      system, with the Gregorian chant and popular songs, enriched the art of 
      music, but continued to consider sound in its development in time, a restricted 
      notion, but one which lasted many centuries, and which still can be found 
      in the Flemish contrapuntalists' most complicated polyphonies.<br>
      <br>
      The chord did not exist, the development of the various parts was not subornated 
      to the chord that these parts put together could produce; the conception 
      of the parts was horizontal not vertical. The desire, search, and taste 
      for a simultaneous union of different sounds, that is for the chord (complex 
      sound), were gradually made manifest, passing from the consonant perfect 
      chord with a few passing dissonances, to the complicated and persistent 
      dissonances that characterize contemporary music.<br>
      <br>
      At first the art of music sought purity, limpidity and sweetness of sound. 
      Then different sounds were amalgamated, care being taken, however, to caress 
      the ear with gentle harmonies. Today music, as it becomes continually more 
      complicated, strives to amalgamate the most dissonant, strange and harsh 
      sounds. In this way we come ever closer to noise-sound.<br>
      <br>
      This musical evolution is paralleled by the multipication of machines, which 
      collaborate with man on every front. Not only in the roaring atmosphere 
      of major cities, but in the country too, which until yesterday was totally 
      silent, the machine today has created such a variety and rivalry of noises 
      that pure sound, in its exiguity and monotony, no longer arouses any feeling.<br>
      <br>
      To excite and exalt our sensibilities, music developed towards the most 
      complex polyphony and the maximum variety, seeking the most complicated 
      successions of dissonant chords and vaguely preparing the creation of musical 
      noise. This evolution towards "noise sound" was not possible before now. 
      The ear of an eighteenth-century man could never have endured the discordant 
      intensity of certain chords produced by our orchestras (whose members have 
      trebled in number since then). To our ears, on the other hand, they sound 
      pleasant, since our hearing has already been educated by modern life, so 
      teeming with variegated noises. But our ears are not satisfied merely with 
      this, and demand an abundance of acoustic emotions.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, musical sound is too limited in its qualitative variety 
      of tones. The most complex orchestras boil down to four or five types of 
      instrument, varying in timber: instruments played by bow or plucking, by 
      blowing into metal or wood, and by percussion. And so modern music goes 
      round in this small circle, struggling in vain to create new ranges of tones.<br>
      <br>
      This limited circle of pure sounds must be broken, and the infinite variety 
      of "noise-sound" conquered.<br>
      <br>
      Besides, everyone will acknowledge that all musical sound carries with it 
      a development of sensations that are already familiar and exhausted, and 
      which predispose the listener to boredom in spite of the efforts of all 
      the innovatory musicians. We Futurists have deeply loved and enjoyed the 
      harmonies of the great masters. For many years Beethoven and Wagner shook 
      our nerves and hearts. Now we are satiated and we find far more enjoyment 
      in the combination of the noises of trams, backfiring motors, carriages 
      and bawling crowds than in rehearsing, for example, the "Eroica" or the 
      "Pastoral".<br>
      <br>
      We cannot see that enormous apparatus of force that the modern orchestra 
      represents without feeling the most profound and total disillusion at the 
      paltry acoustic results. Do you know of any sight more ridiculous than that 
      of twenty men furiously bent on the redoubling the mewing of a violin? All 
      this will naturally make the music-lovers scream, and will perhaps enliven 
      the sleepy atmosphere of concert halls. Let us now, as Futurists, enter 
      one of these hospitals for anaemic sounds. There: the first bar brings the 
      boredom of familiarity to your ear and anticipates the boredom of the bar 
      to follow. Let us relish, from bar to bar, two or three varieties of genuine 
      boredom, waiting all the while for the extraordinary sensation that never 
      comes.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile a repugnant mixture is concocted from monotonous sensations and 
      the idiotic religious emotion of listeners buddhistically drunk with repeating 
      for the nth time their more or less snobbish or second-hand ecstasy.<br>
      <br>
      Away! Let us break out since we cannot much longer restrain our desire to 
      create finally a new musical reality, with a generous distribution of resonant 
      slaps in the face, discarding violins, pianos, double-basses and plainitive 
      organs. Let us break out!<br>
      <br>
      It's no good objecting that noises are exclusively loud and disagreeable 
      to the ear.<br>
      <br>
      It seems pointless to enumerate all the graceful and delicate noises that 
      afford pleasant sensations.<br>
      <br>
      To convince ourselves of the amazing variety of noises, it is enough to 
      think of the rumble of thunder, the whistle of the wind, the roar of a waterfall, 
      the gurgling of a brook, the rustling of leaves, the clatter of a trotting 
      horse as it draws into the distance, the lurching jolts of a cart on pavings, 
      and of the generous, solemn, white breathing of a nocturnal city; of all 
      the noises made by wild and domestic animals, and of all those that can 
      be made by the mouth of man without resorting to speaking or singing.<br>
      <br>
      Let us cross a great modern capital with our ears more alert than our eyes, 
      and we will get enjoyment from distinguishing the eddying of water, air 
      and gas in metal pipes, the grumbling of noises that breathe and pulse with 
      indisputable animality, the palpitation of valves, the coming and going 
      of pistons, the howl of mechanical saws, the jolting of a tram on its rails, 
      the cracking of whips, the flapping of curtains and flags. We enjoy creating 
      mental orchestrations of the crashing down of metal shop blinds, slamming 
      doors, the hubbub and shuffling of crowds, the variety of din, from stations, 
      railways, iron foundries, spinning wheels, printing works, electric power 
      stations and underground railways.<br>
      <br>
      Nor should the newest noises of modern war be forgotten. Recently, the poet 
      Marinetti, in a letter from the trenches of Adrianopolis, described to me 
      with marvelous free words the orchestra of a great battle:<br>
      <br>
      <blockquote> "every 5 seconds siege cannons gutting space with a chord ZANG- 
        TUMB-TUUMB mutiny of 500 echos smashing scattering it to infinity. In 
        the center of this hateful ZANG-TUMB-TUUMB area 50 square kilometers leaping 
        bursts lacerations fists rapid fire batteries. Violence ferocity regularity 
        this deep bass scanning the strange shrill frantic crowds of the battle 
        Fury breathless ears eyes nostrils open! load! fire! what a joy to hear 
        to smell completely taratatata of the machine guns screaming a breathless

        ZANG-TUMB-TUUMB the orchestra of the noises of war swelling under a held 
        note of silence in the high sky round golden balloon that observes the 
        firing..."</blockquote>
      We want to attune and regulate this tremendous variety of noises harmonically 
      and rhythmically.<br>
      <br>
      To attune noises does not mean to detract from all their irregular movements 
      and vibrations in time and intensity, but rather to give gradation and tone 
      to the most strongly predominant of these vibrations.<br>
      <br>
      Noise in fact can be differentiated from sound only in so far as the vibrations 
      which produce it are confused and irregular, both in time and intensity.<br>
      <br>
      Every noise has a tone, and sometimes also a harmony that predominates over 
      the body of its irregular vibrations.<br>
      <br>
      Now, it is from this dominating characteristic tone that a practical possibility 
      can be derived for attuning it, that is to give a certain noise not merely 
      one tone, but a variety of tones, without losing its characteristic tone, 
      by which I mean the one which distinguishes it. In this way any noise obtained 
      by a rotating movement can offer an entire ascending or descending chromatic 
      scale, if the speed of the movement is increased or decreased.<br>
      <br>
      Every manifestation of our life is accompanied by noise. The noise, therefore, 
      is familiar to our ear, and has the power to conjure up life itself. Sound, 
      alien to our life, always musical and a thing unto itself, an occasional 
      but unnecessary element, has become to our ears what an overfamiliar face 
      is to our eyes. Noise, however, reaching us in a confused and irregular 
      way from the irregular confusion of our life, never entirely reveals itself 
      to us, and keeps innumerable surprises in reserve. We are therefore certain 
      that by selecting, coordinating and dominating all noises we will enrich 
      men with a new and unexpected sensual pleasure.<br>
      <br>
      Although it is characteristic of noise to recall us brutally to real life, 
      the art of noise must not limit itself to imitative reproduction. It will 
      achieve its most emotive power in the acoustic enjoyment, in its own right, 
      that the artist's inspiration will extract from combined noises.<br>
      <br>
      Here are the 6 families of noises of the Futurist orchestra which we will 
      soon set in motion mechanically:<br>

</pre>
      Noises obtained by Voices of percussion on metal, animals and wood, skin, 
      stone, men: tarracotta, etc. In this inventory we have encapsulated the 
      most characteristic of the fundamental noises; the others are merely the 
      associations and combinations of these. The rhythmic movements of a noise 
      are infinite: just as with tone there is always a predominant rhythm, but 
      around this numerous other secondary rhythms can be felt.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusions<br>
      <br>
      1. Futurist musicians must continually enlarge and enrich the field of sounds. 
      This corresponds to a need in our sensibility. We note, in fact, in the 
      composers of genius, a tendency towards the most complicated dissonances. 
      As these move further and further away from pure sound, they almost achieve 
      noise-sound. This need and this tendency cannot be satisfied except by the 
      adding and the substitution of noises for sounds.<br>
      <br>
      2. Futurist musicians must substitute for the limited variety of tones posessed 
      by orchestral instruments today the infinite variety of tones of noises, 
      reproduced with appropriate mechanisms.<br>
      <br>
      3. The musician's sensibility, liberated from facile and traditional Rhythm, 
      must find in noises the means of extension and renewal, given that every 
      noise offers the union of the most diverse rhythms apart from the predominant 
      one.<br>
      <br>
      4. Since every noise contains a predominant general tone in its irregular 
      vibrations it will be easy to obtain in the construction of instruments 
      which imitate them a sufficiently extended variety of tones, semitones, 
      and quarter-tones. This variety of tones will not remove the characteristic 
      tone from each noise, but will amplify only its texture or extension.<br>
      <br>
      5. The practical difficulties in constructing these instruments are not 
      serious. Once the mechanical principle which produces the noise has been 
      found, its tone can be changed by following the same general laws of acoustics. 
      If the instrument is to have a rotating movement, for instance, we will 
      increase or decrease the speed, whereas if it is to not have rotating movement 
      the noise-producing parts will vary in size and tautness.<br>
      <br>
      6. The new orchestra will achieve the most complex and novel aural emotions 
      not by incorporating a succession of life-imitating noises but by manipulating 
      fantastic juxtapositions of these varied tones and rhythms. Therefore an 
      instrument will have to offer the possibility of tone changes and varying 
      degrees of amplification.<br>
      <br>
      7. The variety of noises is infinite. If today, when we have perhaps a thousand 
      different machines, we can distinguish a thousand different noises, tomorrow, 
      as new machines multiply, we will be able to distinguish ten, twenty, or 
      thirty thousand different noises, not merely in a simply imitative way, 
      but to combine them according to our imagination.<br>
      <br>
      8. We therefore invite young musicians of talent to conduct a sustained 
      observation of all noises, in order to understand the various rhythms of 
      which they are composed, their principal and secondary tones. By comparing 
      the various tones of noises with those of sounds, they will be convinced 
      of the extent to which the former exceed the latter. This will afford not 
      only an understanding, but also a taste and passion for noises. After being 
      conquered by Futurist eyes our multiplied sensibilities will at last hear 
      with Futurist ears. In this way the motors and machines of our industrial 
      cities will one day be consciously attuned, so that every factory will be 
      transformed into an intoxicating orchestra of noises.<br>
      <br>
      Dear Pratella, I submit these statements to your Futurist genius, inviting 
      your discussion. I am not a musician, I have therefore no acoustical predilictions, 
      nor any works to defend. I am a Futurist painter using a much loved art 
      to project my determination to renew everything. And so, bolder than a professional 
      musician could be, unconcerned by my apparent incompetence and convinced 
      that all rights and possibilities open up to daring, I have been able to 
      initiate the great renewal of music by means of the Art of Noises.<br>
