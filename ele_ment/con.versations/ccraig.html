b.i'd still try to keep that electro-electronic-type feel to it, but acomputer has helped with the sequencing a whole shitload.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>so you would still be using electronic instuments...</i><br><br><b>c-</b>yeah i think so...but the style would probably be different.  becausewhen i play guitar, i play more...um, i mean, i was a big prince fanatic.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>he he.  so what made you go from guitar to keyboards?</i><br><br><b>c-</b>well my cousin had made a song with juan atkins a long time ago called"technicolor," and it was kinda like...he had a sequential six-trak, andlike a 909 and some of the other things around there, that i playedaround with a _little_ bit, and then...i had always loved electronicmusic also like kraftwerk, and-<br><br><i><b>t-</b>tomita?</i><br><br><b>c-</b>who's that?<br><br><i><b>t-</b>oh, man.  you need to hear him.  he's just as influential as anybodyelse.  he does like moog versions of debussy...that kind of thing.he's really worth checking out.</i><br><br><b>c-</b>i had never heard of him...but there were other things like haroldfaltermeyer, "axel f," was a big influence at that time, and then...<br><br><i><b>t-</b>art of noise?</i><br><br><b>c-</b>art of noise i liked a whole lot...and yellow magic orchestra...thatkind of stuff.  also some depeche mode, and other things that hadcome--because when kraftwerk came out with "computer world" i was ingrade school.  i think i was in 6th grade something like that.  i mean,it was a big deal.  i loved that album.  that was like the album that ijust totally loved.  and then with r &#38; b, it was like prince andparliament...those were probably the major influences r &#38; b-wise...slave, that kind of stuff.  so i mean, it's funny that it went thisdirection because it could have gone in any direction.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>ok, obviously you sometimes either sing a sample over top of the musicthat you do, of like your own...is it of your own lyrics of some otherstuff, like..."chicken noodle soup," or-</i><br><br><b>c-</b>oh yeah...things like "chicken noodle soup" are like-<br><br><i><b>t-</b>like off the "psyche" album that you did, in 1990, on transmat?</i><br><br><b>c-</b>oh, on crackdown?<br><br><i><b>t-</b>yeah.</i><br><br><b>c-</b>yeah, it was just like some french that sara gregor was singing, ortalking over the top...so, most of the other lyrics that have been usedhave been original.  there might have been something, uh-<br><br><i><b>t-</b>like "jam the box?"</i><br><br><b>c-</b>well "jam the box" is original too.  it was a sample of an original voice.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>of who?</i><br><br><b>c-</b>69.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>oh, i was about to say...i remember a friend saying he had the albumthat was originally on. </i> [ed. note: the album referred to here is a 12"electro/hip-hop single from 1984 called "jam the box" by "pretty" tonybutler, on the label music specialists inc, from miami...probably notrelated.]<br><br><b>c-</b>no.  i dont know where "jam the box" came from, if someone else usedit...as far as i know it's original voice.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>from who?</i><br><br><b>c-</b>69.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>oh, it is!  ok, wow.  that's just you i assume.  correct?</i><br><br><b>c-</b>(pause) uh, could be.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>he he.</i><br><br><b>c-</b>so anyway...um...<br><br><i><b>t-</b>a lot of people look at the carl craig sound as a "detroit" sound, butit's a detroit sound that's kind of truer to the classical, techno-basedstuff like what the "three greats" did, and as opposed to going into amore mechanical techno-industrial feel like underground resistance andplus-8 and those kind of labels who really havent touched the kind ofstuff that you do in terms of melody.</i><br><br><b>c-</b>i mean, the things i do are like an homage i pay to the thethings that have influenced me.  kevin (saunderson), derrick (may) andjuan (atkins) were influential before i started doing electronic stuff, andthen there were the other people i mentioned that were influences, likekraftwerk and so on and so forth...it's like kraftwerk and undergroundresistance went on a different angle on things because undergroundresistance was in tune with things that were going on at the time, tookit and molded it into their own sound, so it was something that was alittle bit different...where i dont really say, "ok, well, you know, thisis hot today so i'm gonna to take it..."<br><br><i><b>t-</b>so music is not for the moment?</i><br><br><b>c-</b>no, i try to make music for a while...for it to be where you couldlisten to it five years from now and go, "yeah, you know this is areally good song."<br><br><i><b>t-</b>well if you listen to stuff off your first album...</i><br><br><b>c-</b>right.  so that's the whole scoop...just like you can listen to"computer world" and say that's timeless, or if you listen to "one nationunder a groove," they still play THAT here in detroit, and that'stimeless, basically.  "flash," that kind of stuff.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>do you do music that people don't hear that is more along the ambientlines, like the "a.r.t. ep" that you did?</i><br><br><b>c-</b>right.  i mean, i experiment with a whole lot of different things,there are things that i haven't released that would probably just makepeople wonder WHY did i do it...it's a situation where i dont try to getattention held down to one type of genre.  naomi daniel, who i produced,is a little different...it's more housey, [whereas] with "paperclip people"it's different...with whomever.  a carl craig project, or a psycheproject, or whatever...it's going to be different.  actually there'stons of things that only close friends of mine who are like dimitri fromamsterdam who plays at the roxy, and derrick, and some otherpeople...have certain tracks that are only on acetate that will probablynever come out.  no one really knew that was me until it was out...untilsomeone says, "yeah, that's carl craig," because it doesnt really soundexactly like everything i do.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>where do you want music to go, and--you'd be richer if you knewthis question--where do you think electronic music will be in 5 years?</i><br><br><b>c-</b>i dunno.  that's a real funny question because if you look attechnology, "electronic music" to me, is the type of music that we do...butit's also rap, and it's also ambient..._r &#38; b_ is even electronic music,you know?   so...what i was reading just yesterday, about the people whoproduce en vogue and toni toni toni &#38; those guys...sampling used tobe big, everybody used to sample james brown cuts.  but now everybody'sgone to where they bring in their own musicians, and have them jam, andthen sample the jam.  same thing with the beastie boys, they sample theirown jams and then make them into their own loops.  and i think that'sprobably where...some of the music has to go _back_ before it can goforward more.  like with the type of music that we do, it's going to haveto go backwards maybe to some of the sounds that were being done...wellit has been going back to like acid house days, but it might even have togo back further.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>well some of the ambient music, like the david morley ep. </i><br><br><b>c-</b>yeah.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>his stuff is sort of like earlier tangerine dream...</i><br><br><b>c-</b>yeah, david morely is real good.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>where do you want planet e to go?  as far as like the future isconcerned...do you want to keep it like it is, or expand it more to dodifferent types of things?</i><br><br><b>c-</b>well i always want to expand, but the main thing that i _don't_want planet e to be is commercial.  i mean i'd like to put out more records onplanet e.  as more come through, if they pass the restrictive, hard measures-<br><br><i><b>t-</b>which i'm trying to get through! (laugh)</i><br><br><b>c-</b>(laughs) you know, if it's something that i feel will be good,and be good for the label, then i'm going to put it out.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>what do you think of internet, and the recent surge of people whowant to have information given to them _right now_?</i><br><br><b>c-</b>it's real funny because, before, information was a big deal, but itwasn't AS big a deal...<br><br><i><b>t-</b>why do you think that has happened?</i><br><br><b>c-</b>it's sort of like tabloids have made it where information ismore...everybody wants to know "what's going on."  like when 69 came out,everybody's like...or when planet e came out everybody wanted to know whoit is..."who's doin planet e, and who's doin whatever."  and now, withinternet, labels are giving information like what's going on and so onand so forth.  i'd like to get involved in internet, but i just donthave the "know-how" basically.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>what would you get out of using the internet?</i><br><br><b>c-</b>well the first thing i heard about internet was that you could getsounds.  like chick corea might-<br><br><i><b>t-</b>put up a patch...</i><br><br><b>c-</b>yeah.  that's the first thing that came to mind about it.  but now,there are different organizations...like i heard about an undergroundnetwork for musicians...<br><br><i><b>t-</b>the IUMA...internet underground music archives...</i><br><br><b>c-</b>yeah...uh, i guess that's what it is.  there's a whole shitload ofopportunity that it looks like internet can come with, and i am surethere's going to be something very soon now to fuck up internet.<br><br><i><b>t-</b>well, i think things like america online...the more commercialpeoplewho are making money at something that was supposed to be free andnon-commercial...it's like, i dont have a problem with smaller companieslike your own...but when people who have tons of money, they just likeadvertise it...it taints it quite a bit...</i><br><br><b>c-</b>right...<br><br><i><b>t-</b>people are actually happy to see labels like iridal and kudosrecordspop up on the net because they know they are respected in the community...</i><br><br><b>c-</b>isn't black dog on there also?<br><br><i><b>t-</b>yeah, actually they sent me some email last week!</i><br><br><hr noshade size=1><br><br></ul><font size=2>comments to:todd sines <br><a href="mailto:sines@hyperreal.com"><i>sines@hyperreal.com</a></i></font><br><br><p align=right><font size=1>__<a href="../">ele_ment</a>__<a href="./">con.versations</a>__<a href="../im.ages/">im.ages</a>__<a href="../think./">think.</a>__<a href="../ask./">ask.</a>__<a href="../said&did/">said&did</a><br></font>.<br><br>.<br><br><a href="../ele_mental.html">.</a><br><br><font size=1><a href="../../ele_mental.html"><img align=middle alt="e l e . m e n t a l" src="../../ele_images/.o.center.gif" lowsrc="../../ele_images/.o.center.lowres.gif" width=85 height=35 border=10><br>home</a></font></p></font></body></html>
