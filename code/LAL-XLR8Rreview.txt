LAL 
CORNERS 
PublicTransit/CAN/CD 
Hip-hap producet Nicholas Murray and vocalist 
Rosina Kaan first bllaborated as LAL back in 1998, 
with their first recorded outing surfacing the tollow- 
ing year on the youthful Toronto label Public Transit. 
The material itself is impressive in its successful 
coupling of the coffee table-eased listening of 
artists like Morcheeba with the edgier production 
ethic of Lamb. With live dates introducing a number 
of instrumentalists to the crew, their debut extends 
upon, without losing the original premise of, Last 
Stop. Crisp beats and grainy studiosonics supple- 
ment Kaan's sleepy delivery. The slow-motion, 
though still raging,loops of "Torturing Instrumental" 
are the perfect antidote to me wandering torch 
songs of "2 See Love Broken." Kings/ey Marshall
