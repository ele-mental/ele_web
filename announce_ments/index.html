        <br>
        <a href="http://www.nezzwerk.com/POLE/">POLE</a>, aka Berlin-based Stefan 
        Betke, has pioneered a whole new approach to electronic music&#151;amplifying 
        the hisses, pops, and scratches of old Jamaican dub music into new depths 
        of bass, space, and rhythm. His highly-acclaimed releases on Matador Records, 
        as well as earlier releases for DIN (not to mention his influential stint 
        as mastering engineer for the world-regarded Dubplates & Mastering), have 
        pricked up the ears of electronica and indie fans alike. Meanwhile, releases 
        on his own label ~SCAPE have offered a home to some of the richest dub-infused 
        music around (including music by perennial ele_mental favorite KIT CLAYTON).</p>
      <p>Pole's live performances have also left impressions on audiences all 
        over the world&#151;turning many a night club and basement venue inside 
        out with the crackling reverberations of his bass-heavy music. Join us 
        as we mark Stefan¹s first appearance in Central Ohio, one of only five 
        stops on his current US tour. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nezzwerk.com/POLE/">ANDREW PEKLER</a>, a Californian 
        now based in Germany, also seeks ³imperfections² in his music, combining 
        the usual electronic rhythms with live, human improvisations. Inspired 
        by the early electronic work of Herbie Hancock and Sun Ra, Pekler is often 
        joined in the studio and onstage by jazz musicians. His explorations of 
        guitar-based sounds were originally released under the name SAD ROCKETS 
        (for Source/Matador), but a recent relocation to Berlin has led to numerous 
        new projects, including the first full album under his own name, entitled 
        Station to Station (~SCAPE 2002). With this new work, Peckler betrays 
        an influence from the Berlin dub-techno sound, which, like his own material, 
        creates a seductive interplay between human and machine elements. </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.nezzwerk.com/POLE/">JEREMY BIBLE</a> has quietly 
        been making waves in the Northeast Ohio electronic music scene for the 
        last several years. With a musical range that encompasses the fluidity 
        of electro, the abrasiveness of dark drum&bass, and the emotional richness 
        of melodic electronica, Jeremy is all but guaranteed a wider audience 
        in the near future. Be among the first in Central Ohio to witness this 
        up-and-coming artist first hand. <br>

      <p>'REMAINDRED PHRASES' LEAVES ITS MARK</p>
      <p>after some last-minute difficulties, REMAINDERED PHRASES is a wild success, 
        featuring a whole series of site-specific dance pieces and works in progress. 
        highlights of the evening include MATTHEW MOORMAN's brief performance 
        singing with himself (age 3), excerpts from longer works by HEATHER MIMS 
        and CASSIE MEADOR, new sketches by KENDRA PORTIER, ERIN CARLISLE, and 
        SYLVANA CHRISTOPHER, a disturbing video work by MARLON BARRIOS-SOLANO, 
        and ed luna's own strange dance quartet featuring live noise accompaniment.</p>
      <p>the event also marks the first collaboration between marcus matthews 
        (on guitar), ed luna (on decks) and jamie love tate (on vocals), creating 
        smooth, expansive mood music. DAVE TINAPPLE's installation/projection 
        fails to work this time out, but no doubt we will work with him again, 
        as well as the other scheduled acts, SILENCIO and DJ ASHWIN, who both 
        were unable to participate.<span class="credit">--ele_mental</span></p>

      <p>ELE_MENTALS ON THE MOVE</p>
      <p>several ele_mentals have recently left the fold of columbus, ohio, towards 
        new horizons.</p>
      <p>TODD SINES has just made his break to toronto, with a short gig in the 
        after effects business, while ADAM REITZ has relocated to the sunny climes 
        of miami, florida. check out adam's latest project -- a website for numark's 
        revolutionary new turntable, the ttx1 (check <a href="http://ttx1.com/">www.ttx1.com</a>)-- 
        which, incidentally, was designed by longtime ele_friend ROB WARDEN!</p>
      <p>one-time collaborator ANDREW BYRD has also left for warmer climes, joining 
        KRISTA ANKENY in ele_mental's ever-growing presence on the west coast.</p>
      <p>TIM MADONNA moved to the denver area last summer and has continued making 
        music (look for mp3s to be uploaded here soon!).</p>
      <p>meanwhile, ANDREW BABSON is pursuing graduate studies at the prestigious 
        london school of economics, and regularly hosts an internet radio show 
        mondays on pulse FM (check <a href="http://pulsefm.co.uk/">pulsefm.co.uk</a>).<span class="credit">--ele_mental</span></p>

        between techno, house, hip-hop, drum + bass, jazz, and Latin-infused rhythms 
        with each release. PTR has represented this cohesive sound in Columbus 
        since 1998, with appearances at various FIREXIT and ele_mental events. 
        Kevin has gained the attention of the European labels UK's Reinforced 
        and Germany's Compost, featured on their new &quot;Future Sounds of Jazz 
        vol. 8&quot; compilation. His latest release, &quot;DUPONT&quot;, has 
        captivated the interests of such luminaries as Giles Peterson, 4-Hero's 
        Dego McFarlaine + Mark Mack, and legendary Detroit producer Carl Craig. 
        This evening Kevin will perform the latest compositions designed to make 
        the hips shake and the dance&szlig;oor move with his signature combination 
        of bossa nova, hip-hop, and techno. Check out his broken beat breakdown 
        at <a href="http://www.ptrmusic.com">http://www.ptrmusic.com/ </a></p>
      <p> TODD SINES:: LIVE PA<br>
        Returning from his recent European tour, and several dates in NYC and 
        San Francisco, Todd will unveil his new fusion of experimental techno 
        with deep, dark, house music, in his last Columbus show before his move 
        to Toronto. This performance will feature his new work with Toronto vocalist 
        Natacha Labelle, to be released this spring on Germany's minimal house 
        label Perlon, as well as selections from his forthcoming Force Inc. album. 
        Expect deep, sensual melodies, booty-shaking basslines, and raw, syncopated 
        rhythms, inspired by the bedroom, but felt on the dance&szlig;oor. Hear 
        it at <a href="http://www.scalestudio.com/sound/mp3/todd_sines/">http://www.scalestudio.com/sound/mp3/todd_sines/</a></p>
      <p> VENUS:: DJ<br>
        Flippin it on all sorts of levels, Venus, aka Tashish has been mashing 
        out blends of real hip hop, all incarnations of deep soul, freaked out 
        broken beat, tweaked out house, and meditative abstract biznizz in Toronto. 
        She honed her turntable chops and mic skills hosting, programming, and 
        producing a weekly Toronto radio show alongside DJ Dalia for 7 years steady. 
        Prepare yourself for jams that make you sweat + some sick ass beats.</p>
      <p>DIALECT:: DJ<br>
        Mano Narayanan, DJ Dialect, is the other ringleader of PTR, bringing his 
        ear for raw drums + lo-&#133; sample hooks from hip-hop, drum + bass, 
        and eclectic beats from across the world. Dialect has always kept to his 
        roots', that's why he has never abandoned the hip hop head inside of him. 
        However, with his appreciation for all types of electronic music, Dialect 
        is not afraid to take sets from West London to New York in a hot minute, 
        with tuff breakbeats always being the key his sets.</p>
      <p>FRANKIE GUNNS:: DJ<br>
        Fractured drum addict, aka Shaggy, has gained strong notoriety in the 
        Toronto music scene with his production as Orion and his slew of influential 
        mix tapes. Gunns, admired by all, but only loved by the ladies, has never 
        been shy to pull out his skills to show and prove--razor sharp faderwork 
        keeps trainspotters drooling, while his tight drum + bass mixes keep the 
        dancefloor heated.</p>

      <p>DARKSIDE 9: THE 9TH CIRCLE SELF-REVIEW</p>
      <p>after a rather low-key 8th event in november 2000 featuring KID 606 and 
        other TIGERBEAT 6 artists, the DARKSIDE series returns to form with a 
        9th installment, entitled THE 9TH CIRCLE, coordinated by DYSKINESIA and 
        ELE_MENTAL's edward luna.</p>
      <p>housed at BLD studio, a former lumber mill turned low-tech studio space, 
        DARKSIDE begins with a capable set of dark ambience by SEVEN e-zine's 
        impresario, ANTON. smoothly mixing a CD-only set that ranges from abused 
        atmosphere to broken beats, anton sets the stage nicely for the rest of 
        the event. GREG TRASH (aka AMERICAN TRASH from akron) follows with a short 
        set of live breakbeat noise on two computers.</p>
      <p>ELUNA continues with a short DJ set of noisy electro before being joined 
        by MARCUS MATTHEWS (formerly of the band MAKESHIFT CONQUEST) on guitar, 
        and TIM RAMAGE (of THE LACK and BLOW UP) on guitar and keyboard, creating 
        an onslaught of sound that blurs the distinctions between techno music 
        and live instrumentation.</p>
      <p>the real surprise of the night is pittsburgh's XANOPTICON, who proceeds 
        to tear up the joint with his live, unhinged breakcore set. his performance 
        adds a well needed element of presence to the computer music scene, as 
        he frantically engages with his equipment.</p>
      <p>world-renowned break-core troublemaker VENETIAN SNARES (aka aaron funk 
        from winnipeg, canada) follows suit with a set of his own latest CDR creations. 
        snares had been scheduled to appear with warp/rephlex artist MU-ZIQ at 
        the wexner center for the arts until that tour was cancelled, so naturally 
        we were happy to have the creator of such fine works as &quot;doll doll 
        doll&quot; in our midst. and he did not disappoint.</p>
      <p>the event ends with a tag-team set of strangeness from DJs APOSTOLIC 
        and YUUKIMAIKO, representing local noisecore crew DYSKINESIA.</p>

      <p>MALFUNCTION RAVE EVENT BUSTED;COLUMBUS SCENE UNDER THREAT</p>
      <p>in what amounts to a swan song for columbus' long-fledgling underground 
        rave scene, an event by columbus stalwarts MALFUNCTION is shut down at 
        1:30 AM on the evening of the 17th. using three full floors of the same 
        warehouse that was used for a smaller, one room event in july (TRANSIT), 
        the ravers and the music attract too much attention from the authorities 
        this time. after arriving at the space at about 1 AM, the police are quick 
        to threaten the promoters with various citations if they do not shut down 
        immediately. luckily, FABRICE LIG, coming all the way from belgium, still 
        manages to perform his rare live set to a group of eager listeners.</p>
      <p>even so, one can't help wonder what this means for the future of true 
        undeground electronic music events in columbus. ele_mental's own solution 
        (for the time being) has been to use a stable space like the dragonfy 
        annex for recurring events, but other alternatives should exist in order 
        to ensure a healthy scene.</p>
      <p>i myself find the columbus police department's policies inconsistent 
        and disturbing. on the one hand, they have frequently harrassed (or left 
        unprotected) alternative spaces for creative expression, such as FIREXIT, 
        ADDITION 13, LEGION OF DOOM; but at the same time they are slow to respond 
        to much more serious recreational drug and alcohol abuse found in mainstream 
        clubs and campus keg parties.</p>
      <p>a more rational alterntative (and one used by european and canadian law 
        enforcement agencies until recently) is a policy of engagement and selective 
        enforcement.</p>
      <p>instead of immediately shutting the party down, sending dozens or hundreds 
        of kids onto streets and highways in the middle of the night (often on 
        drugs), the CPD should find ways of negotiating with the promoters on 
        the spot, to reasonably ensure everyone's safety while making an honest 
        assessment of the situation at hand. if a clear threat to public safety 
        exists (such as an obvious fire hazard), then the authorities should have 
        the right to enforce the law; if it is merely a few dozen kids dancing 
        in a warehouse all night, and no threat exists, let the party continue!</p>
      <p>if anyone cares to make their own views on this matter public, please 
        call the CPD internal affairs bureau at 645-4880, or write to columbus 
        mayor michal coleman's <a href="http://mayor.ci.columbus.oh.us/mac_comment.htm">action

      <p>COMPOUND OO4 REVIEW</p>
      <p>the 4th COMPOUND event hosts cincinnati's resident experimentalist JOSHUA 
        TREBLE, who dazzled a small crowd at a show in columbus during the winter 
        of 2001, and montreal's acclaimed sound artist MITCHELL AKIYAMA. joshua 
        and mitchell collaborate live at this event for only the second time, 
        performing a set of densely layered glitch techno that is a driving as 
        it it supple. ed luna opens the event with some of his usual noisescapey 
        electromashing.</p>
      <p>unfortunately, with last-minute promotion, and the absence of todd sines 
        (who is spending several weeks in new york and europe), the event suffers 
        from very poor turnout - reminding us yet again of the poor support electronic 
        music receives in our own backyard.</p>

					<p>COMPOUND 003 BRINGS SAFETY SCISSORS</p>
					<p>SAFETY SCISSORS, aka mattew curry, returns to columbus fresh from his 
        recent move to berlin, germany. his set is a pleasant mix of experimental 
        glitch techno with some <a href="../events/compound/compound003/P9290060.jpg">live 
        vocals</a> and rock'n'roll posturing, including a brilliantly stripped-down 
        cover of NEW ORDER's &quot;age of consent&quot; (!). he ends the evening 
        with a short <a href="../events/compound/compound003/P9290104.jpg">DJ 
        set</a> featuring some favorites from his back catalogue of fellow glitchy 
        techno producers.</p>
      <p>before SAFETY SCISSORS, <a href="../events/compound/compound003/P9290040.jpg">charles 
        noel</a> (aka ARCHETYPE) lays down a set of live, shuffly, tribal techno 
        that has become his trademark. as if it needs to be repeated, charles' 
        releases for 21-22 CORPORATION, GLYPH, BLACK NATION, and ONGAKU have slowly 
        transformed techno (and even house) music. charles is preceded on the 
        decks by our longtime collaborator <a href="../events/compound/compound003/P9280021.jpg">THOMAS 
        JAMES</a> (of RESIDUAL RECORDINGS), with a set of low-key tech-house;

      <p>GEOFF WHITE'S 'QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS' ALBUM REVIEWED</p>
      <p>&quot;One of the most talked about electronic artists to emerge out of 
        the USA, Geoff has jumped out of nowhere, with a handful of critically 
        acclaimed 12&quot; releases on Force Inc., Cytrax, Morris Audio and Delay 
        plus a praised performance at Detroit's Electronic Music Festival this 
        year his rising popularity is sure to expand with the release of his debut

        soothing beats that's intended for the DJ but translates well in the bedroom, 
        Geoff White comments musically on his dissatisfaction with the repetitiveness 
        of the electronic mainstream and questions the abilities to diversify 
        the genres by adding his own unique interpretation of sonic explorations

      <p>at long last, columbus plays host to one of the world's foremost purveyors 
        of abstract techno; berlin's own MONOLAKE, whose many releases for the 
        critical CHAIN REACTION label, as well as FORCE INC and CYTRAX, have forged 
        a new path in the electronic realm. his set does not disappoint the eager 
        crowd of over 100 attendees.</p>
      <p>columbus' own techno wonderboy GEOFF WHITE (CYTRAX, FORCE INC) also chimes 
        in with his usual shimmering live performance, and DJs todd sines and 
        MELIA (debut appearance) get their groove on as well. projections are 
        provided by DAVID TINAPPLE, and the event also serves as an opening for

      <p>ELE_MENTAL INITIATES NEW MONTHLY SERIES: COMPOUND</p>
      <p>COMPOUND 001 is the first event of a new series initiated by todd sines. 
        with a crowd of 50-plus people at hand. the event begins with an eclectic 
        set of hop, techno, drum'n'bass, and house by charles noel, followed by 
        a set of new experimental/atmospheric techno works by todd sines as <a href="http://www.scalestudio.com/sound/" target="_blank">NERIQ</a>. 
        ele_regular <a href="http://www.twinesound.com/" target="_blank">TWINE</a> 
        (hefty records, kent ohio) then lays down a set of distressed ambience 
        before giving way to the evening's highlighted artist, <a href="http://www.marumari.com/" target="_blank">MARUMARI</a> 
        (carpark records, NYC). MARUMARI's set is vintage &quot;electronica&quot; 
        with an earnest, almost rock'n'roll twist; ironic without losing its sensitivity 
        and emotion.</p>
      <p>overall, the music is well received but the event itself lacks the energy 
        of a dance party. however, it is greatly enhanced by the live video manipulations 
        of PHASE4 (cleveland) and DAVID TINAPPLE (columbus), who create horizontal 
        strips of abstract/semi-recognizable material that shimmer and implode 
        on themselves endlessly.</p>

      <p>DEPARTURES: SATURDAY JUNE 2, 2001, DFLY ANNEX</p>
      <p>edward luna spearheads another end-of-school event featuring dance, music, 
        art, and fun.</p>
      <p>the event begins with an opening for aaron henderson's paintings and 
        a viewing of his latest dance/performance film, 'inflateables.' several 
        dance pieces follow, including kelly gottesman's haunting group piece 
        'between breaths' which occurs mostly in the dark, lit occasionally by 
        a single, glaring worklight; jenny pommiss' quartet 'twinings,' with the 
        dancers balancing teacups on each other while maneuvering around on red 
        chairs; and carrie houser's quartet 'carbonate,' featuring the dancers 
        in white pyrex painters' suits with mirrored goggles, tracing very angular 
        movements to the music of steve reich's 'drumming.'</p>
      <p>ACTIVENOTPASSIVE picks up after the dances, returning after a long absence 
        from performing, with a stripped-down configuration featuring ed luna 
        on decks, marcus matthews on guitar, and tim ramage on drums; later joined 
        by charles noel performing live as ARCHETYPE, as ed slips off to perform 
        an improvised dance to charles' music (a preview to their appearance at 
        the SONAR festival in spain). detroit's MAERSK follows up the event with 
        a short set of abstract, immersive, noisy techno.</p>
      <p>the space is also graced by the huge, hand-cast light-brites made by 
        marina del rosario huang.<span class="credit">--ele_mental</span>

      <p>with the <a href="../events/annex/betabodeganorth/betabodeganorth-front.jpg">PITCH 
        CADET</a> show just behind him, todd sines scores an appearance by manchester's

        well as the BETA BODEGA COALITION. thus, another beta bodega show is born, 
        attracting a small but attentive crowd.</p>
      <p>the event begins with DJ sets by AMOS and ARCHETYPE, followed by the 
        live portion, and the fractured electro music of stewart brown and gerrod 
        martin as SERVO. a battered todd sines follows as NERIQ, with a highly 
        abstract set of atmospheric tech-house that, despite the technical snafus, 
        hearkens back to his early-90s material as ENHANCED. DATATHIEF closes 
        the event with an enthusiastic electro set that combines old-school 80s 
        sensibilities with pile-driving beats.</p>
