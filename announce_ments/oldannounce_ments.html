								<b>ANotherEXit...ANNEX SPACE MAKES ITS DEBUT</b><br>
								

ANNEX is a new gallery / performance space, located next to Dragonfly
restaurant at 245 King Avenue (the former home of Byzantium). Coordinated by Matt Clausen and the Firexit collective, ANNEX is a coalescing of Firexit's energies into a consistent, storefront
space. ANNEX will serve as a home base for Firexit activities, providing
an ever-changing, detail-oriented environment in which to experience art,
music, film, dance, and ideas collectively. </font>
							<p><font color=#333399 face=geneva, arial size=2>
 
ANNEX will also offer other curators and organizations the opportunity to
organize, curate and produce their own events; lending the experiences of
art, music, film, installation and performance a new dimension of
diversity, quality, and street visibility that may, we hope, reach a
larger audience.</font>
							<p>
							<p><font color=#333399 face=geneva, arial size=2><b>ANNEX Opening</b><br>
									
ANNEX will open its doors on Saturday, September 30th with a live
performance by Berlin musician and "sound designer" Oval (aka Markus Popp,
Thrill Jockey / Mille Plateaux Records). Oval is highly regarded as an
avatar of the new German art/electronica scene, pioneering a new approach
to "sound art" that is changing the face of electronic music today. Oval's
microscopic mutations of CD skips, digital clicks, and resonant
frequencies has found a worldwide audience amongst fans of ambient music,
techno, indie rock, and experimental music alike.</font>
							<p><font color=#333399 face=geneva, arial size=2>

Oval will headline this show as part of FIREXIT 18, also featuring recent
works by local artists Clint King, Josh Fields, and David Tinnapple, as
well as a realtime digital video installation by San Francisco artist
David Robert. Oval will be supported with live experimental ambient music
by former Betaroric guitar/keyboardist William Johnston (Philly), and live
techno music by Stewart Brown (Betabodega).</font>
							<p><font color=#333399 face=geneva, arial size=2>

Dragonfly, a recently-opened restaurant specializing in high-quality
organic and vegetarian fare (located next door to ANNEX), will remain open
throughout the show and provide a full cash bar.</font>
							<p>
							<p><font color=#333399 face=geneva, arial size=2><b>Oval Lecture at CCAD</b><br>
									
Firexit and the Columbus College of Art and Design are co-sponsoring a
lecture by Oval artist Markus Popp on Friday, September 29th at 9:30
a.m. in CCADs V-Hall. The lecture is free, open to the public, and will
include a discussion and demonstration of generative art-making in the
digital realm. CCAD is located on Gay St between Cleveland Ave and
Washington Ave in downtown Columbus.</font>

								<b>WERE YOU THERE?</b><br>
								

YOU ARE HERE, an event coordinated by ANDREW BABSON, successfully reanimates the ele_mental vibe. without a hint of pretention, YOU ARE HERE recaptures the feeling of many older ele_mental events, by taking the basic rave formula and adding simple, but effective elements; including a chill-out room by DOOR/WAY that features an intense set by toronto's LAL (featuring 4 players, including sitar!). projections by firexit, and simple installation elements created by the audience itself. <br>
								<br>
								
the highlight of the evening, however, is in celebrating charles noel's 30th birthday with two 12-inch cakes decorated to look like records! that, plus fabulous music by such ele_mental regulars as detroit's BILEEBOB, toronto's MOONSTARR + GENETIC, and ele_mental west coast representatives VALENCE and MIRA, provides this evening with a family-style vibe that reminds us all why we got into this in the first place. thanks to andrew and all those involved in the creation of this event.<i>&#151;ele_mental</i>

								<b>VANGUARD ELECTRONIC MUSIC FROM EUROPE ENERGIZES WEXNER CENTER</b><br>
								

PRESS RELEASE:
<i>"Electronic music is being flocked to by young composers who are doing to
it something like what punk bands did to rock 'n' roll in the
mid-'70s."</i>-New York Times in a May review of Fennesz and Pita<br>
								<br>
								

Leading European electronic musicians Fennesz/Pita/Schmickler make their
Columbus debut-on their first-ever U.S. tour-in the Wexner Center
Performance Space on Sunday, July 16 at 7 pm. Following their phenomenal
recent CD collaboration The Magic Sound of Fenn O'Berg with American
innovator Jim O'Rourke, Christian Fennesz and Peter Rehberg (aka Pita)
arrive in the U.S. with co-conspirator Marcus Schmickler (aka Wabi Sabi).
Fennesz and Rehberg are central players on the influential Mego record
label, a Vienna-based home for electronic musicians and DJs hotwiring
laptops and other devices for improv action. Joined by Schmickler, they'll
create edgy digital soundscapes in a show designed for listening rather than dancing.<br>
								<br>
								

Sonic radicals In recent years, computer music has evolved to allow for
genuine improvisation. From music for chill-out rooms in clubs and the
rave scene to Internet exchange of computer-generated music, the artists
of the Mego label have been at the forefront of this global scene.
Christian Fennesz began his career as a singer/guitarist/songwriter in the
group Maische, incorporating free-form improvisation and instrumental
rock. With the band's demise in 1993, Fennesz started experimenting with
new electronic techniques, and has since composed for dance, film, CD-ROM,
and art and multimedia installation.<br>
								<br>
								

The New York Times has called his music "pleasing, enveloping"; his recent
releases include Hotel Parallel and Plus Forty Seven Degrees 56'37" Minus
Sixteen Degrees 51'08". A DJ at various locations in the Viennese
underground for a decade, Peter Rehberg (Pita) started playing
ambient/experimental music in the early '90s. Rehberg has released a
variety of solo and collaborative recordings and is a remixer for other
artists. Recent releases include Get Out and Seven Tons for Free. A
veteran of the German electronic scene, Marcus Schmickler is known for his
densely layered electronic sounds. Besides his solo work, he has worked
with such German groups as Mouse on Mars, POL, Can, and Kontakta. His most
recent release is Sator Rotas. For further information on Fennesz and
Pita, check <a href="www.mego.at" target="_blank">www.mego.at</a>. <i>&#151;wexner center for the arts</i>

<b>LAST EXIT [?]: FIREXIT 17</b><br>

over the last two years, FIREXIT has attempted to bring diverse arts,
sounds, and people together into one space. now it is time for us to reflect
on what we have accomplished so far, and gather strength for the next
phase. <br><br>

FIREXIT 17 brings dance, movement, music, and music together for one last
[?] experiment. with site-specific dance works from the OSU department of dance, music and movement by MAN + MACHINE [detroit], ambient + experimental music by WILLIAM JOHNSTON, as well as ROB LITCHFIELD + DAVID REED (of AVANT COLLECTIVE), and a CD release party for toronto's <a href="http://www.ptrmusic.com">PUBLIC TRANSIT RECORDINGS</a>.<br><br>

FIREXIT 17 is the last event scheduled to occur at our current downtown space. for the time being, there are no firexit events planned. even so, expect to find some surprises throughout the summer, and possible new [Fe] configurations in time for the fall. <i>&#151;firexit</i>

<font color=#352015 face=geneva, arial size=0>[29 january 00]</font><br>

<b>FIREXIT DOESN'T WAIT FOR GODOT</b><br>
FIREXIT hosts a succesful revival of samuel beckett's famous 1953 play about "nothing," <i>waiting for godot</i>, performed by cleveland's startup theater company CHARENTON THEATER. in addition, the event features some installation artwork, a film, a dance improvisation, and 3 musical acts.<br><br>

<i>godot</i> is performed twice, once at 4pm, another at 8pm. at over two hours in length, it proves to be a grueling ordeal for much of the 100-plus audience. the play is FIREXIT's first venture into theater (and CHARENTON's first repertory performance), providing beckett's masterwork with an unfinished, threadbare look which only contributes to its existential complexity and tense emptiness. performed on a home-made wooden stage (supported by lengths of pipe underneath), and lit only by clip-on lights overhead, both organiations prove that a low-budget production need not compromise clarity of purpose, even in reviving one of the most misunderstood and challenging works of the 20th century.<br><br>

the second showing of <i>godot</i> is followed by SEAN BANNON's hilarious short film entitled "the boy with the big head," bringing the remaining audience great joy in its depiction of a sad, neglected boy whose only fault is having a large, papier-mache head. after the film, edward luna takes the decks in place of BAMBULE COMMANDO, whose travel arrangements were nixed due to poor weather conditions. while ed plays a BAMBULE-inspired set of noise, breakcore, hardcore, and electro, ALYSSA STITH improvises a subtle dance, balancing the extremity of sounds with her swirling bodily movements. SPECIAL AVIATION PROJECT next contributes a scorching set of tight, angular rock instrumentals, and is followed by the return of ele_mental's KEVIN KENNEDY as THE FEARLESS BLACK NIGHT, closing the event with his throbbing set of live, relentless techno.

<b>FIREXIT 000-1 RINGS IN A NEW YEAR - ALMOST</b><br>
firexit finally opens - tentatively - in a new, semi-restored building in downtown columbus, with an event one day before 2000 hits (hence the 000 minus 1). this time the space is much smaller and easier to manage than the old mckinley avenue warehouse. and the space is a lot older, dating back to the early 20th century, making it an interesting challenge to refurbish. much of the old structural elements remain intact, including ceiling fans, streaky paint on the walls, and rickety wood floors stained with years of filth. yet by all reports, the new warehouse gets points for its intimacy and its fabulous location.<br><br>

the evening's event begins with a rock set by GOLDEN, followed by electronic noise improvisations by BINDER + TIM in the spacious basement. a little later, back upstairs, TRANS AM plays to a full house, plying their unique mixture of rock with electronic elements for nearly an hour. then, several DJs, including DJ IF (j.r. gualtieri), TODD SINES, and TITONTON, mix it up for the after-hours crowd. <i>&#151;Fe</i><br>

<b>DARKSIDE 7 BRINGS THE NOISE TO COLUMBUS</b><br>
the latest DARKSIDE event succesfully infiltrates the ears and minds of columbus' electronic and noise music fans with the extreme, fractured sounds of london's hardcore scene, thanks to a US tour organized by maria moran (aka ZIPPER SPY) of vinyl communications. the event is centered on the dark, sick drum+bass sounds of london's ZHARK label, headed by rachael kozak (aka HECATE), and features a scorching live performance by HECATE, with DJ sets by BEN FEAR (of BOMB DOGS), and PRAXIS founder CHRISTOPH FRINGELI (who plays his uniquely twisted noise+bass for a blisteringly full three hours). <br><br>

old-school noise is also well-represented, with an opening performance by EMIL BEAULIEAU (aka ron lessard, founder of the influential noise label RRRecords, out of lowell massachusetts); whose disturbingly funny combination of wild gesticulations, dada poetry, and free-form noise (courtesy of his own multi-armed turntable) are a special highlight. ZIPPER SPY herself also puts in a live performance of her own noise/techno music, while local yokel DJ PANTSHEAD warms up the party with his zany mix of records, noise, and MP3 samples, and gordon sharp (a longtime resident of london who tried to create an audience for this kind of music throughout a two-year stay in columbus) closes with a satisfying DJ set of noisy, screechy beats as BAMBULE COMMANDO. live projected visuals are provided by WALTER WRIGHT, an experimental video artist whose abstract work spans back to he 1970s.<i>&#151;eluna</i>

<b>FIREXIT AIN'T DEAD YET</b><br>
rumors abound about the so-called "death" of firexit, but they are unfounded. true, the 1229 mckinley avenue space is indeed up for sale, but matt clausen has worked out a new month-to-month lease for himself and 2 other tenants, and has also created a protocol to rent additional space for special events. so for the time being, firexit is alive and well, and every day that goes by is another 30 days it will continue to reside at its current space. however, matt feels that the building is not likely to sell before the end of the year, and in addition to that, several firexit members are working on getting a new space and proposing a business plan to ensure that firexit continues well into the future.

<b>FIREXIT 12 ATTRACTS OVER 200</b><br>
over 200 people attend the latest firexit event, despite last-minute promotion and no traditional "big-name" acts. this time, nearly the entire warehouse area is used, filled only with enormous wooden benches huddled close to the ground,
sparsely-hung artwork on the industrial walls, several low-key installations, and well-placed atmospheric lighting - made from simple nite-lights, clamp lights with colored bulbs, and various other threadbare solutions. for the first time, a firexit event evokes a clear, spacious, minimalist atmosphere that is new to the usually crowded and disorienting series of events. in addition to the new spaciousness, the usual mixture of music is well-represented: including a rip-roaring set of soulful hip-hop by RJ-D2 (with MCs from MHz), a set of heart-wrentching rock by JASON TRAEGER, and the quirky highlight of the evening, IQU, whose blending of indie rock, drum'n'bass, and japanese plasti-pop (and whose instrumental assortment includes turntables, samplers, live upright bass, and live theremin!) are a real thrill. also featured are techno DJ TODD SINES to celebrate the release of the 21.22 corporation's "ele_ments of light" CD, and an ambient area set up by ele_mental, featuring live music by BILL JOHNSTON of BETARORIC.

<b>RESIDUE EVENT FINDS NEW HOME</b><br>
the bi-weekly event called RESIDUE, planned and promoted by our friends THOMAS JAMES and KEVIN KRAHEL, has undergone a hiatus in recent weeks due to management and sewage problems at its former home, the SMILING RHINO bar. now, TJ says the event is moving to AXIS nightclub (775 n high st, short north area) and will occur every wednesday, starting october 6th. a relatively new club that has until recently focused most of its promotional efforts on the local gay dance music community, axis does have the potential to be as special a place for us as the rhino was, despite the awkward sound system and invisible DJ booth hidden up on the balcony.

<b>NEW ELE-MENTAL SERVER IN THE HOUSE</b><br>

TONY RAMOS and MICHAEL GULDAN finally get the new ele-mental server over to the INTERNET CONCOURSE office (also home of COIL), through which we will soon be routed. for the time being, the old site is still up, but soon all web requests will be handled by our own server instead of being housed on the pico.concourse.com server.

SOMATIC RESPONSES appears in columbus for the first time at an event called ELECTROMASH MAYHEM. the event is a collaboration between MAD LAB, ele_mental, and gordon sharp; and is the first to highlight the drastic experimental music of the london underground scene. the event begins with a set of mischeivous noise by gordon as BAMBULE COMMANDO, followed by a DJ set and live electro performance by john healy of SOMATIC RESPONSES. the event closes with another revival of the ACTIVEnotPASSIVE players including matt clausen, matt bailey, tim ramage, ed luna, and mark gunderson. the event is sponsored  by MAD LAB's eric meyers, and is one of the first events held at THE LAB (105 n grant ave), a new venue for experimental theater. turnout is low but the sound is blaring, and the several dozen people that do arrive are supportive and interested. this event also represents a culmination of gordon sharp's desire to expose this kind of music to columbus listeners, an effort that had been constantly thwarted during his two years as a columbus resident.

ACTIVEnotPASSIVE 8.0 is the fullest expression of the AnP concept thus far, bringing the materials of installation art together with abstract electronic sound and bodily movement in a festive environment. unfortunately the event comes on the heels of a week-long media expose on the central ohio rave scene, and is poorly attended by ravers and dance music aficionados. also, the promotion of this event is similar to that of AnP 7.0, made with abstract geometric shapes that say very little about the actual event, asking the audience to make their own meaning in the absence of obvious information. despite the low turnout (perhaps 60 people), AnP 8.0 does succeed on certain levels, as one of the most ambitious electronic music events ever held in columbus.<br><br>

the event takes place in the firexit warehouse space. from the entrance, a winding path of cardboard leads the audience back through the offices towards the main performance room, which is also covered in cardboard and immersed in red light. the audience must walk past a large lung-like installation by charles noel and then proceed between musical performers in order to reach the larger dance area. meanwhile, designated dancers (loosely organized by mara frazier) are instructed to perform short, clustered movement improvisations and then revert back to normal bodily movement. these clusters (which are also mirrored in the music) eventually reach a climax. sometime during this climax of dance movement (which consists of much writhing on the floor and contact improvisation), as well as musical mayhem (including a DJ, noise-maker, drummer, guitarist, and others) certain ambitious members of the audience begin to rip up the cardboard floor and build a large, abstract house/sculpture that encompasses the entire center of the performance area.<br><br>

the audience consists mostly of art and dance students, which lends the event a "happening" kind of feel. however, the failure of the event is in its inability to surpass its own "artsiness," which could only have happened with the attendance and participation of more ravers and non-art-oriented people.

gallery hop is a roaring success thanks to warm, friendly weather, and ele_mental is there - represented by ARAMOS and RATFINK.  later that evening LUNAR represents with a 2-hour set at MAYDAY in cleveland, while .PLACEBO. and TITONTON make their mark at OPERATION LIBERATION on the homefront.

FIREXIT 9 garners some media attention from THE OTHER PAPER (a local weekly), with firexit cru and friends shown on the cover.  the event itself is among the most object-oriented firexits thus far, highlighting installations by artists from the cranbrook academy of the arts (bloomfield, MI).  other highlights include work by jonathan smith (aka DJ SENSE), another brilliant sculpture by nathan hamilton, cory piehowicz's rough-cut video documentary "dan" (which ganrnered some well-needed laughs), low-key indierock sounds by ASSEE LAKE and TIARA, and the ACTIVEnotPASSIVE concept, which comes alive again to close the night with some experimental soundscapes, featuring mark gunderson (keyboards), tim ramage (guitar, keyboard), ed luna and todd gys (turntables), matt clausen (drums), and mike "the redheaded one" richards (keyboards).

<hr>

<font color=#352015 face=geneva, arial size=0>[3 april 99]</font><br>
the seventh ACTIVEnotPASSIVE event takes the rave formula to a different level.  5 DJs, a drummer, bassist, keyboard/guitarist, and noise artist combine with 5 experimental dancers to create an intense audiovisual experience.  not quite a party, not quite a concert, not quite an art show, but something exactly in between.   a great collaboration between ele_mental's ed luna, the firexit cru, and some open-minded dancers from the OSU dance department.  the performers include mark gunderson, angular, dreamcycle, lunar, and kenya dubois on turntables; matt clausen on drums; matt bailey on bass; tim ramage on keyboard, guitar, and drums; and the allmonster chorus.  dance organized by mara frazier and kate connely.<br><br>

the same evening tony ramos sets up at gallery hop again, this time with beautiful, cooperative weather.  as always a good time is had by all.

ele_mental returns to the midsize-rave business with SNOWED*IN.  attendance runs over 600 people and by most accounts it is a success.  the space is divided into 3 areas including a hangout room with computers, a snow*cone machine, and art on the walls.  in the main room, detroit's SHAKE plays a brilliant live set in absolute darkness, and PARIS & BILLEEBOB tear it up with their tag-teaming action.  in the second room detroit's BRIAN GILLESPIE makes some noise with his blend of hip-hop, electro, and old-school funk, while the rest of the night is a free-form tag-team including great moments between PARIS, TITONTON, and DIVINE.

<font color=#352015 face=geneva, arial size=0>[6 february 99]</font><br>
ele_mental sets up at gallery hop again, creating yet another little stir with our "crazy beats."  a fun time is had by all including ed, tony, J.R., delcina, and dara, entertaining a very diverse crowd of passers-by.<br><br>

later that night (23) resurfaces to create an atmospheric room at CAKE, a rave presented by our friends at surreal productions.  this time out, charles and ed create some crazy musical landscapes with turntables, keyboards, a microphone, and various noisemakers.  sounds veer from harsh, to peaceful, to layered, to noisy, to quiet.  J.R. also jumps on to play some passive music as well.  meanwhile, tony brings out some cool games and a video drawing device.  returning to our roots, perhaps?

announcing our monday night event MENTAL has officially moved to INSOMNIA, on n high st across from the OSU campus.  after residing at the sugar shack for nearly 2 years, ed luna decides it's time to reach out to new people in a new space.  everyone is encouraged to come out and check out our experimental-style music, it's free and continues from about 10.30 PM - 2 AM.

FIREXIT 7 goes off nicely, with gallery sounds and an event-closing tag-team by the ele_mentals.  other highlights include a very experimental fashion show with stage and lighting design by FIREXIT, with clothing by LEE LEI, a soul DJ set by ZAKKIYAH, and live bands BETARORIC and KOOSTARK, plus some great artwork.

<hr>

<font color=#352015 face=geneva, arial size=0>[16 january 99]</font><br>
the ele mentals set up 'sweat'shop, a second room at VITAMIN E, and rocked it with sets by PLACEBO, TJ, FBK all the way from north carolina, and tim madonna. ARAMOS finished up the night with a four-hour marathon set.

PLACEBO causes a ruckus on the decks down at the latest weekly event called END, at bernie's distillery (traditionally an indie rock venue, but what the heck!).

charles noel (MONOCHROME) spins in london to ring in the new year.  there are last-minute problems with the venue but despite this the place is crammed with over 2500 people (which was only 1/2 what they had originally planned for!).  anyway, charles has 
a good time, and even manages to stop by reinforced headquarters to shoot the shit and score some more records.

<hr>

<font color=#352015 face=geneva, arial size=0>[10 december 98]</font><br>
FIREXIT 6 goes off well, with much-improved artwork on display and a respectable reaction to _dutch harbor_, an experimental non-narrative film featuring live accompaniment. TWINE and BAMBUKE COMMANDO represent the electronic experimental vibe, and turn a few heads with their dark sounds.  meanwhile, the ele_mentals' usual lighter gallery-style fare earns them a few more fans every time.

<font color=#352015 face=geneva, arial size=0>[5 december 99]</font><br>
HOLIDAY HOP, the christmas edition of gallery hop, was a lot of fun for everyone, and ele mental was sure to be in on it. ARAMOS put on his santa hat and played non-stop for a capacity crowd that jammed the sidewalks during the 70-degree heat (!?!)

LUNAR makes his way up to toronto to join forces with the public transit recordings posse, at CODE 416 RETURNS.  PTR is a family-style crew trying to bring hip-hop, drum-n-bass, and techno together in a low-key setting, as well as a resource for releasing music by toronto's underground artists.  more collaborations with the ele_mentals are likely.

LUNAR plays for a record-breaking 4 1/2 hours at GOBBLE 7.  the third floor room was supposed to be for other DJs as well but ed ended up hogging the tables all night, playing everything from kraftwerk to samba to miles davis, while meeting lots of cool, 
interesting ravers and restoring his faith in the scene.

MENTAL becomes the unofficial meeting place to discuss the state of the columbus underground art and music scene, from all angles including electronic music, punk/hardcore, and avant-garde art.  meetings include members of FIREXIT, MORE THAN MUSIC, and ELE_MENTAL, but the floor is open to anyone.  discussions start before MENTAL, around 9.30 PM.

<hr>

<font color=#352015 face=geneva, arial size=0>[14 november 98]</font><br>
TITONTON's performs live with vocalist LEAH HOOVER, violinist IAN JESSE, clarinet by NICOLE HASSOUN, a bass-cellist, and drummer at NAVIGATE.  the performance was marred by nagging sound problems, but the performers are very tight and the music shines through.  stunning to behold, we hope T decides to do this particular set again in a more intimate setting.<br><br>

.PLACEBO. also plays this event, in a small (and extremely hot!) racquetball court.

<hr>

<font color=#352015 face=geneva, arial size=0>[22 october 98]</font><br>
TITONTON heads off for a week and a half jaunt to france and switzerland, playing dates in paris, bourges, and other smaller cities.
