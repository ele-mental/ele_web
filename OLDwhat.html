<b>ele mental</b> began in may 1993 as a loose, undefined affiliation of people brought together by their involvement in the (modest) electronic music culture of columbus, ohio. <br><br><hr></td>

we are not a collective in the traditional sense.  ele_mental is more about the individuals who have associated themselves with it, and the process through which each of us has come to a greater understanding about what our electronic culture can offer us.<br><br>

most of us are continuing to explore the vast possibilities of electronic music, whether through production or just spinning records (or both).  some of us are deeply engaged in the creation of electronic visual forms and graphic design.  some of us are struggling to create stronger links between new ideas, and older art forms.  a few of us even throw events to try to put these ideas into practice.  but there is no agenda.  we just do what we do as individuals, and come together when we need to--through technology, graphic design, donating time or equipment at our events, advice, honest opinions, investment, and so on. <br><br><hr></td>

as an event-throwing entity, ele_mental started with the notion of creating affordable dance music parties with an experimental and artistic edge.  over the past 5 years, we have thrown over 30 events--from the biggest mega-raves to some of the smallest, most experimental underground events of the midwest region.<br><br><hr></td>

another high-visibility project is the ongoing <b>21/22 corporation</b>, a project which began with experimental noise/hip-hop in 1992, and whose first vinyl release was the "reconnaissance" drum'n'bass EP by <b>monochrome</b> in early 1995.
several vinyl releases have followed, featuring ele_mental (and ele_related) artists.  some of these releases have gained overseas attention, and our experimental, low-budget package designs are a natural articulation of ele_mental ideals.<br><br><hr></td>

the <b>(23)</b> concept extends ele_mental and 21/22 into more abstract artistic areas such as improvisational performance and installation environments.  <b>(23)</b> also exists as an online experiment (in need of update). <br><br><hr></td>

<td valign=top>
<font size=2>
__<b>minimalism</b> - can be an excuse to say little, but 'less is more' is still the concept of the century.<br>
__<b>detroit techno</b> - a new, technological music shaped into being in a ruined, yet somehow undefeated city. <br>
__<b>drum'n'bass</b> - pushing beats, and therefore our minds, into unimaginable realms (<b>reinforced</b> has been our literal guide).<br>
__<b>dark electro</b> - remembering those abstract electronic beats that made us contort our bodies in the early '80s (<b>kraftwerk</b> has never been boring to us)<br> 
__<b>house</b> - the deep sounds of soulful house music move us, whether they be chicago's sparser, traxier side; disco-based funkifications; or new york's jazzy, sophisticated club house.<br>
__<b>noise</b> - john cage may not have been our literal guide but we hear the sounds all around us as music...and a layer of sonic grunge can be a marvelous thing.<br><br><hr>
