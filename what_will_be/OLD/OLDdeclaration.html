<font size=1><i>a personal testimony, by <b>ed luna</b></i></font><br><br>

<b>no more raves!!</b><br><br>

that's basically what i said back in mid-august, in a net-wide announcement and on our "what.will.be" page.  based on the the many reactions i have gotten to this declaration, there are a lot of people who did not want to see ele_mental throw in the towel...<br><br>

<b>but i never said we were throwing in the towel!</b>  in fact, in that very same declaration, i said that "ele_mental is far from over."  apparently, no one read that far.  i also wrote about the kind of events i hoped to throw:<br>

<blockquote>
<i>"through [a] different style of events it is hoped that a new, more diverse kind of audience will be reached: electronic music lovers, punks, cyber geeks, artists, experimental performers, new explorers, those disgruntled with the rave scene, and of course, open-minded ravers. . . . [a] new phase of ele_mental. . .geared toward reaching out to new kinds of people. . .</i></blockquote><br>

does this sound like someone who's quitting?  i don't think so.  in addition, i also wrote these hopeful words about our future:<br>

<blockquote>
<i>. . .we are all encouraged to carry on in different ways, in different areas, much in the spirit of our first few events in 1993.  we hope that some of you will join us as we return to our basic, funda_mental roots.</i><blockquote><br>

does this sound like the end of something?  well, not the end, just a re-boot.<br><br>

so. let me clarify again.  <b>ele_mental is not over</b>.  these webpages will stay up, and continue to grow.  the table of ele_ments voicemail will continue to be updated.  MENTAL will continue to happen at the sugar shack every monday.  and we will continue to do events, of various shapes and sizes.<br><br>

so why such a drastic declaration?  well, on some basic levels, ele_mental has changed.  first of all, we've lost a few valuable crumembers.  back in april, <b>kevin kennedy</b> (aka <b>powerhouse</b>) moved to charleston, south carolina.  in late august, <b>kevin ginger</b> (aka <b>valence</b>) moved to portland, oregon, joined by <b>mira abellera</b>, ele_mental's first female coreperson.  the kevins were both very active participants, and their presence will be sorely missed.  as for mira, we hope we were generous in sharing what we built, even if she was only with us for a short time.  no matter where they go, we know they will all carry ele_mental with them.<br><br>

meanwhile, <b>tony ramos</b> is also seriously contemplating a change in location, and <b>charles noel</b> (aka <b>monochrome</b>) will be studying abroad in the fall of 1998 (in birmingham, england), with an uncertain future afterwards.  charles and tony have been the most active members of ele_mental throughout the years (aside from myself), so their absence will be very strongly felt.<br><br>

but the primary change in ele_mental has occurred within me.  for over 3 years now, i have almost singlehandedly set the tone of the ele_mental ideal: conceiving and executing over 30 events primarily by myself, actively maintaining the table of ele_ments voicemail, designing and maintaining the entire ele_mental website, and spreading the message through my continued net-presence on rave lists such as 313, mwraves, and pb-cle.  so the painful fact about ele_mental is that it's got "ed" written all over it.<br><br>

but that's not how it was meant to be.  ele_mental was always meant to be more of a collective idea, a looser, more fluid concept.  because i had the time, and because i actively sought to build something like ele_mental, i took it and ran with it.  in the process, i often made it hard for people to contribute on the foundation level.  if they did contribute, it was usually only after i had built a structure. no one wants to claim ownership for a structure when all they did was add a few flourishes here and there.  yet i still continued, from mid 1995 until june of 1998, to build this thing mostly by myself.


of course, it hasn't all been bad.  i have taken the ele_mental idea and used it to encourage a deeper awareness of electronic music (and music-making); its history, its connection to art and technology (among other things), its complexity, and its simplicity.  these are things which you just don't hear much about at other parties (but that's another story). i've also personally tried to keep every event i've done cheap, without regard to money-making. 

of course, it hasn't been all bad.  much of what i have done has been with an eye towards something bigger than myself; something that could exist in a
diverse form, without need to be defined in a concrete way.  besides, most
of the concepts i talk about (minimalism, futurism, underground vs.
mainstream, etc) are FAR bigger than me.  all i can do is "represent," in
the hip-hop sense.  but who knows?  the reverberations of the things i
have done continue to bounce back to me in surprising ways (being told
that i "set the tone" for the columbus scene?  walking into speed records
in toronto and seeing ele_mental posters and pictures all over the wall? 
receiving emails from out of the blue: somebody read "think," or heard one
of us play, or discovered the webpage?  and so on...).<br><br>

but over the last few months, and through actual dialogue with most of the
principal ele_mentals, i have come to realize that my conception of ele_mental
must end.  i must burn down the house i have built, and start anew (it's amazing what a few face-to-face round-table meetings can do!). 
 
i fired myself, the head of state.

this is due in part to
exhaustion, lack of support, and the difficulty of promoting experimental
ideas within the climate of today's overloaded rave scene.  there simply
isn't room for my kind of low-key, cheap, and experimentally-inclined
events within today's scene.  i can't compete, and i shouldn't have to.
<br><br>

it would be too easy for me to use this as an excuse to tear into the rave
scene and point out its many problems, or blame the scene for failing to
reach towards what i offered. but i just can't do that, because that's not the
real reason things needed to change with us.  the rave scene is what it is,
it's always had elements of light and dark, with lots of greys in between. 
so what?  

so what does this mean for me?  well, like george macunias, the leader of
the fluxus art movement in the 1960s, i can still speak for ele_mental,
and define it in whatever diverse terms i feel are appropriate.  i can
still keep the web pages. i can still do the voicemail.  these are things i'm good at, and enjoy doing, so why not continue doing them?  but for
ele_mental to really mean anything, i've got to re-invent myself.  i can
no longer operate the way i have been operating.  i've got to let people in on the ground floor, and create an atmosphere where others can step in and claim ele_mental as their own, contribute to it in whatever way they feel comfortable, use it as a resource, or simply attach themselves to it to become part of something meaningful.  this very webpage is itself (i hope) the final stand of "ed_lemental"; my final act of self-destruction, in order to re-build.<br><br>


even though these personnel changes are the most drastic we have ever faced, in some sense, nothing will really change.  just as jeff mills is and forever shall be an honorary lifetime member of UR, ele_mental is something you can carry with you.  it is a mindset, and a resource, as much as it is a physical group of individuals working towards something.<br><br>

<b><i>but what does it all mean, really?  what does the future hold?</i></b><br><br>

as for the real, concrete side of ele_mental, who will really be left?
what will our roles be?  what will we try to do?<br><br>

well, i cannot speak for anyone else, as much as i have tried, and will
probably continue to try (heck, i am a writer, for god's sake ;).  at this point, i can only speak for myself.  i do know that i will continue to be in a leadership role.  yet my challenge will be do do this in such a way that the structure remains open to others. <br><br>

as far as events, i will continue to present MENTAL every monday night at
the sugar shack cafe (1950 n. 4th st.), and i do expect to spearhead a few
small electronic music events in the fall (including the ongoing ele_ment
concert series and the ACTIVE.not.PASSIVE experimental event series).
while these events will be "rave-related," they will not be geared specifically to the rave community.  they will be on a small scale, possibly free, and combine the cerebral aspect of galleries and art shows, with the bodily aspects of parties; in the hope of bringing the best of both worlds together to create something new.<br><br>

moreover, ele_mental's roots in the rave experience can never be denied, and we will continue to reach in that direction whenever possible or practical.  for example, i plan to continue luggung the ele_mental sound system out to various raves and other events, to create a small area for sonic experimentation.  i plan to continue to promote myself as a DJ (lunar), playing my more immersive style of music to a wider rave audience.<br><br>

but the real hope is to create a new kind of audience made up of a random
and diverse group, including (but not limited to) electronic music lovers,
punks, cyber geeks, artists, experimental performers, new explorers,
disgruntled old-school ravers, and new ravers.<br><br>

this new phase of ele_mental will therefore be geared toward reaching out
to new kinds of people, many of whom might not come from a rave (or even elecronic music) background.  we will also undoubtedly reach out to the many people who are already ele_affiliated, asking them to join us in a more concrete way.  we will also reach out to those of you who have left the rave scene (for many reasons), and see if together, we can build something that can speak to everyone.  <br><br>

finally, if you have been paying attention from afar, and have wanted to contribute, but may not have known how...now would be a good time to reach out and make your presence known. ele_mental is far from over.  please write to our communal account at <a href="mailto:element@pico.concourse.com">element@pico.concourse.com</a>, which will automatically forward your words to various members of the cru.<br><br>

only time will tell if our move away from raves will be permanent, but we
are all encouraged to carry on in different ways, in different areas, much
in the spirit of our first few events in 1993.  we hope that some of you
will join us as we return to our basic, funda_mental roots.<br><br>


to those of you who have been there...thanks.  for those yet to come,
welcome!<br><br>
