ele_mental is in the process of transition.  as an event-throwing entity,
ele_mental will no longer continue as it has over the last several years,
defined and promoted primarily by me, edward luna.  it was never meant to
be that.  from our very beginnings in early 1993, ele_mental was always
meant to be something more collective, more inclusive, and
farther-reaching.  but that's not how things ended up.  so, for the short
term, <b>ELE_MENTAL IS FINISHED THROWING RAVES, OR RAVE-ORIENTED
PARTIES.</b><br><br>

i hope our silence over the intervening months will be noticed, and
that those who are interested in continuing to expand the ele_mental ideal
will contact us and join us.<br><br>


but why are things changing???  if you really want to know, read <a href="./declaration.html">THE REST OF THE STORY</a>.<br><br>



for the meantime, this "what.will.be" page will focus on events in which the
ele_mental sound system or where specific ele_mental performers will be featured.<br><br>

  <font size="4"><b>COMFEST '98 RENEGADE</b></font></p> <p>Emboldened by
our successful foray into Columbus' mainstream arts event, the Gallery
Hop, the ele mental sound system will attempt to stage a completely
unauthorized appearance at the perimeter of Community Festival '98 in
Goodale Park. We might play all day and into the night, or be shut down in
the first half hour. It all depends on the strength of support we receive
from the crowd.</p>

<p>Even if you've never been to ComFest before, come out and be counted as
a supporter: for ele mental, for electronic music, and, yes, for the
ideals of diversity and community that we (and ComFest) promote. Let them
know there is a large audience that appreciates having a true alternative! 
<i>-tony</i></p> <p>p.s. even if we do get kicked out, we may have use of
a nearby location. If you don't see us in the park, keep looking!</p>
<p><font size="2">time: approx. 2:00PM - 11:00PM each day. Admission to
the ele mental sound system, and the Community Festival, is <i>free</i>. 
Donations GREATLY appreciated.</font></p>

<hr>
<p>???</p>

<p>Rumour has it that the imminent departure of core ele mentals Kevin
Ginger and Mira to Portland will not go by without a parting celebration
of some kind...at this time, however, official sources would not comment
further. &lt;grin&gt;
