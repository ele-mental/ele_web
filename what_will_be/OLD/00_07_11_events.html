PRESS RELEASE:<br><br>

<i>"Electronic music is being flocked to by young composers who are doing to
it something like what punk bands did to rock 'n' roll in the
mid-'70s."</i>-New York Times in a May review of Fennesz and Pita<br><br>

Leading European electronic musicians Fennesz/Pita/Schmickler make their
Columbus debut-on their first-ever U.S. tour-in the Wexner Center
Performance Space on Sunday, July 16 at 7 pm. Following their phenomenal
recent CD collaboration The Magic Sound of Fenn O'Berg with American
innovator Jim O'Rourke, Christian Fennesz and Peter Rehberg (aka Pita)
arrive in the U.S. with co-conspirator Marcus Schmickler (aka Wabi Sabi).
Fennesz and Rehberg are central players on the influential Mego record
label, a Vienna-based home for electronic musicians and DJs hotwiring
laptops and other devices for improv action. Joined by Schmickler, they'll
create edgy digital soundscapes in a show designed for listening rather than dancing.<br><br>

Sonic radicals In recent years, computer music has evolved to allow for
genuine improvisation. From music for chill-out rooms in clubs and the
rave scene to Internet exchange of computer-generated music, the artists
of the Mego label have been at the forefront of this global scene.
Christian Fennesz began his career as a singer/guitarist/songwriter in the
group Maische, incorporating free-form improvisation and instrumental
rock. With the band's demise in 1993, Fennesz started experimenting with
new electronic techniques, and has since composed for dance, film, CD-ROM,
and art and multimedia installation.<br><br>

The New York Times has called his music "pleasing, enveloping"; his recent
releases include Hotel Parallel and Plus Forty Seven Degrees 56'37" Minus
Sixteen Degrees 51'08". A DJ at various locations in the Viennese
underground for a decade, Peter Rehberg (Pita) started playing
ambient/experimental music in the early '90s. Rehberg has released a
variety of solo and collaborative recordings and is a remixer for other
artists. Recent releases include Get Out and Seven Tons for Free. A
veteran of the German electronic scene, Marcus Schmickler is known for his
densely layered electronic sounds. Besides his solo work, he has worked
with such German groups as Mouse on Mars, POL, Can, and Kontakta. His most
recent release is Sator Rotas. For further information on Fennesz and
Pita, check <a href="www.mego.at">www.mego.at</a>. <i>--wexner center for the arts</i><br><br>
