<b>BETA BODEGA COALITION: THE OHIO CHAPTER<br> </b>The global-based <b>Beta Bodega Coalition</b> cannot be pre-packaged, bold-texted, paraphrased, or highlighted for you, but on November 4th, ANNEX will bring them to fit snugly into the white box for one evening only. Propaganda posters will call you out; Juan Valdez will stare blankly back at you freed from peddling coffee beans. Exploited logos of South American industries are finally free to speak of South American culture. The familiar token images of Chiquita bananas are no longer comforting, and you can hardly forget the continuing U.S. imperialism reserved for your textbooks. While the electronic beats they produce soothe the night, members speak aloud, plug in to their laptops, and wait for you to be down with the Cause. </font></p>

<p><font face=geneva, arial size=2><b>THE DETAILS </b><br> FIREXIT, + SCALE, and ANNEX present the latest in a series of multimedia events at the ANNEX space, 245 King Avenue [adjacent to Dragonfly neo-v cuisine]. This marks the first-ever Ohio appearances of the Coalition; as well live electronic performances from <b>TPM</b>, <b>Safety Scissors</b>, and <b>Sutekh</b>. In addition to the imported talent from Miami + San Francisco, Columbus recording artists <b>SERVO</b> and <b>neriq</b> will be performing live. </font></p> 

<p><font face=geneva, arial size=2>ANNEX will showcase the collaborative effort between design collectives <b>PLEX</b> + <b>SCALE</b>, featuring guerrilla-style art­propaganda posters, video loops, label arts and informative slides that reinforce the harrowing effects of imperialism and globalism on third world countries of Latin America. </font></p>
        
<p><font face=geneva, arial size=2><b>THE ARTISTS</b> <br> <b><i>music</i></b></font><font face=geneva, arial size=2><br> Laptop orchestra [all artists are performing live with Mac G3 Powerbooks + audio software]: </font></p> <p><font face="Geneva, Arial" size="2">Edgar Farinas, who records for Beta Bodega as <b>TPM/The Panamanian Militia</b>, AKA <b>Push Button Objects</b>, has recorded on England's SKAM, Miami's Schematic and his own Chocolate Industries, and Chicago's Hefty. He's also one-half of Ko-Wreck Technique, a collaboration DMC Worldwide Champion DJ Craze on Sheffield, England's prestigious Warp Records, home of electronica favorites Aphex Twin, Autechre, Red Snapper, Plaid, Seefeel, and Broadcast. </font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva, Arial" size="2">Miami's <b>V8</b>, another high-ranking member of the coalition, will be performing with TPM, doing spoken word through Edgar's laptop effects rig. </font></p> <p><font face=geneva, arial size=2>Matthew Curry, AKA <b>Safety Scissors</b>, works in support for Cycling74.com, developer of MaxMSP, the node-based audio software that Matthew uses for his deconstructivist tech-house tracks. He records for Germany¹s Force Tracks, pioneers in the new era of icy "glitch-house", New York City¹s Carpark, Los Angeles' Plug Research, and San Francisco's Context, Belief Systems, and Orthlorng Musork. He has a forthcoming release on Beta Bodega. </font></p> 

<p><font face=geneva, arial size=2>There will also a special live appearance of San Francisco¹s tech house producer Seth Horvitz, AKA <b>Sutekh</b>, who has recorded for Germany¹s Mille-Plateaux, Force Inc., Background, and Klangkrieg, Texas¹ Tektite, and San Francisco¹s Drop Beat, Delay, Context [his own], and Cytrax. He is just returning from a tour in Eastern Europe, which included stops in St. Petersburg and Croatia. </font></p>         

<p><font face=geneva, arial size=2>Stewart Brown and Garred Martin comprise the Columbus duo <b>SERVO</b>, which has a forthcoming release on Beta Bodega's offshoot label, Rice + Beans. Stewart has previous releases on Columbus' own (k)nob records and Black Music. </font></p>         

<p><font face=geneva, arial size=2>Todd Sines will be performing new material as <b>neriq</b>. Todd is a co-founder of ele_mental, co-collaborator of FIREXIT, and director of design collective SCALE. He has previously recorded for Germany's Background, England¹s Peacefrog and Reflective UK/2000 Black [Reinforced Records offshoot techno label], Detroit's Planet E, 7th City, Chicago's Contact, NYC's Spelunk, and Columbus' 2122, Residual, and Black Music. He has forthcoming releases on Detroit's Throw and Miami's Beta Bodega.</font></p>

<p><font face=geneva, arial size=2> <b><i>art + design</i></b></font><br> <font face=geneva, arial size=2>The ANNEX space will transform into the visual voice of Beta Bodega Coalition. Miami's <b>PLEX</b> [Steven Castro] and Columbus' + <b>SCALE</b> [Todd Sines, Matt Clausen, Dan McMahon] will magnify the distinct guerrilla marketing aesthetic Beta Bodega is known for. Large-scale propaganda posters, silk-screens, stencils, video loops, and slide shows adorning the walls will further embellish and reinforce the BBC cause. </font></p>

<p><font face=geneva, arial size=2><b>THE CAUSE </b></font></p> <p><font face=geneva, arial size=2>Large multinational companies in Central America have caused dispossession and deforestation of land and resources in Brazil and Costa Rica. Two-thirds of the world's leading banana growers have been sterilizing their work force for decades. Producers of infant formulas, chocolate, and cosmetics are exploiting their workers and supporting oppressive regimes. The US counter-attack to the Nicaraguan Sandanistas guerilla army, also known as the Contras, secretly tried to stop the "war on drugs"; initiated by President Ronald Reagan and CIA director William Casey in 1981. The Boland Amendment to the 1983 military appropriations bill stated that none of the appropriated defense funds could be used to "train, arm, or support persons not members of the regular army for the purpose of overthrowing the government of Nicaragua." In response to this amendment, Oliver North quickly set up his own method of funding the Contras, later known as the Iran-Contra affair. The Colombian drug cartel connection to the Crips and Bloods of Los Angeles was born as well. </font></p>         

<p><font face=geneva, arial size=2><b>THE BACKGROUND</b> </font></p> <p><font face=geneva, arial size=2>"Though the record label was formed in 1999, Beta Bodega was a monthly event in Miami, Florida, which started the year prior. The concept was that of a gathering focusing on third world issues, not in the conventional sense of but rather via experimental uses of media such as electronic music, design, typography, photography and video. Beta Bodega releases have covered a variety of issues from past and present events in the third world such as the US invasion of Panama, heightened paramilitary death squad activity in Colombia and the CIA created terrorists known as the Contras in Nicaragua, just to name a few. However these issues are addressed in a mix of abstract electronic music and varied experimental graphic design pieces rather than through text only in an effort to communicate in a more effective manner. Conceptually Beta Bodega begins with the bodega, a small variety store that can be found on any given block within any given Hispanic urban community. Due to the multi-purpose function of this store it becomes central and focal point, both commercially and socially, for everyone within that community. A place of meeting, transferring and exchange. Beta is the complete physical movement forward. Alpha equals 1, Beta equals 2. When we move 1 foot forward it's only a step, but it isn't until you move the second foot forward that you actually walk. This forward motion is what we're all about. It's the Coalition that moves Beta Bodega forward. Beta Bodega Coalition is a wide group of people that are down for our cause, the people's cause: designers, DJs, hackers, foot soldiers on the streets and electronic musicians from around the globe." ­Steven Castro, Beta Bodega Coalition <br> </font></p>
