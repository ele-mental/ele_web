<i><b>a few ideas and things to live by</b></i><br><br>

<b>minimalism</b> - can be an excuse to say little, but 'less is more' may still be the concept of the century.<br>
<b>detroit techno</b> - a new, technological music shaped into being in a ruined, but undefeated city. <br>
<b>drum'n'bass</b> - pushing beats into unimaginable, fractured realms - <b>reinforced</b> has been our guide.<br>
<b>electro</b> - remembering those abstract electronic beats that made us contort our bodies in the early '80s<br> 
<b>house</b> - the deep sounds of soulful house - whether they be chicago's sparser, traxier side; disco-based funkifications; or new york's jazzy, sophisticated club house.<br>
<b>noise</b> - john cage may not have liked repetitive music but his ideas opened us all up to the possibilities of "non music."<br>
<b>voluntary simplicity</b> - without realizing there was a movement behind it, many of us have already been trying to make the most out of the materials and ideas at hand.<br>

<b><i>a few things we can't live without</i></b><br><br>

<b>atari 2600</b> - let's admit it - those programmers did some amazing things with almost nothing!<br>
<b>vector graphics</b> - wireframe video games still look more advanced.<br>
<b>turntables and vinyl</b> - need we say why?  still the preferred (and better) medium for DJ interpolations.<br>
<b>macintosh</b> - 10% share of the market, and it's still better.<br>
<b>amiga</b> - 0% share of the market, and it's still better. 1987 technology at its best.<br>
<b>star trek</b> - some of us may admit to liking star trek, but don't bet your tribbles on it.<br>

<b><i>a few things we can live without</i></b><br><br>

<b>TV</b> - for some reason, only 1/2 of us even own one, and the 1/2 that do, don't watch it.  i guess we're not missing too much.  does this mean we're free to think for ourselves?<br>
<b>happy hardcore</b> - it sure is fun to wish this music would disappear, but it insists on existing.  like a virus.<br>
<b>slow breaks</b> - okay, okay...it's a cheap shot, but most of us just can't get with music that is so blatant.  or inherently dated.  it was great in '91, but we ain't dwelling on it...<br>
<b>money</b> - yah we is busted broke, for the most part.  so what?  our economy is too profit-driven anyway.  "ecologically-sustainable stability" should be the catchword.  and we still have our integrity, right?  right?!?! ("less is more...less is more...less is more...")<br>-->
