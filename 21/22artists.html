          <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Charles Noel</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          (Archetype) is founder, president, and primary artist for the 21-22 
          Corporation. <br>
          <br>
          From its modest beginnings as a cassette-only, industrial breakbeat 
          label, Charles has overseen every aspect of the Corporation's growth 
          and development. He has utilized the label as an outlet for his own 
          artistic growth: as a visual artist in the digital realm, an unacknowledged 
          pioneer of North American drum'n'bass (Monochrome), and a highly-respected 
          tribal techno producer (Archetype).<br>
          <br>
          At the same time, he has also allowed the Corporation to serve as a 
          testing ground for other like-minded artists including Todd Sines, Titonton 
          Duvante, Kevin Kennedy, Morgan Geist, Kevin Moon, and Mike Szewczek. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Since 1998, Charles has performed all over North America, and has made 
          appearances in the UK, Belgium, Germany, and The Czech Republic. In 
          June 2001 he was also featured at the famed <a href="http://sonar.ya.com/english/programme.html">S&oacute;nar 
          Festival</a> in Barcelona, Spain.<br>
          <br>
          His releases for <a href="http://www.black-nation.com/home2.html">Black 
          Nation Records</a> (Michigan) and <a href="http://www.klang-elektronik.de/">Ongaku</a> 
          (Germany) are only a few among the many in the works; including a mysterious 
          new sublabel strictly for his material as Archetype, called GLYPH. <br>
          <br>
          Charles is also a formidable techno and house DJ, and is co-founder 
          of the <a href="../ele_mental.html" target="">ele_mental </a> collective, 
          spearheading several of its more conceptual events. </font></p>

          (eluna) is primary designer and editor for the 21-22 Corporation.<br>
          <br>
          Edward has helped guide the Corporation through its many transitions: 
          from a low-tech, cassette-only enterprise, to an internationally-recognized 
          experimental music label.<br>
          </font></p>

          experimental DJ, choreographer, and co-founder of the <a href="../ele_mental.html" target="">ele_mental 
          </a>collective. As part of ele_mental, Edward has spearheaded dozens 
          of conceptual underground music events, including collaborations with 
          <a href="http://www.undergroundresistance.com/">Underground Resistance</a>, 
          <a href="http://www.ptrmusic.com/">Public Transit Recordings</a>, <a href="http://www.black-nation.com/home2.html">Black 
          Nation</a>, <a href="http://www.reinforcedrecords.co.uk/index1.htm">Reinforced</a>, 
          and <a href="http://chat.carleton.ca/%7Enmedema/cindytalk/">Gordon Sharp</a>; 
          many of which have blurred the edges between underground dance party, 
          &quot;happening," installation, and salon-style concert.<br>
          <br>
          Edward has performed as a DJ across North America (see August 9, 2001 
          on <a href="http://www.betalounge.com/">Betalounge</a>), M&eacute;xico, 
          and at 2001's <a href="http://sonar.ya.com/english/programme.html">S&oacute;nar 
          Festival</a> in Barcelona, Spain. His own sublabel, as yet unnamed, 
          is to feature noise-influenced electro. <br>
