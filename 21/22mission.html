          is an interdisciplinary entity exploring music, design, and performance. 
          Since 1992, the Corporation has been at the forefront of experimentation, 
          releasing a wide range of products emphasizing the affinities between 
          electronic music production and innovative design aesthetics. In 2000, 
          the Corporation's uniquely packaged CD compilation "Ele_ments of Light" 
          garnered a Judges' Choice Award from world-renowned designer Matt Owens, 
          of <a href="http://www.one9ine.com/">One9ine</a>/<a href="http://volumeone.com/">VolumeOne</a>.

          the 21-22 Corporation and its parallel concept, <a href="../ele_mental.html">ele_mental</a>, 
          have also been involved in many inter-media events, exploring the grey 
          areas between sound, film, video, sculpture, installation art, computer-mediated 
          environments, and contemporary dance.</font></p>
