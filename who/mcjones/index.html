<b>info::</b><br><br>

from the time chris jones first heard "blue monday" by <b>new order</b> in 1984 (thanks to his sister alyssa), he knew he was attracted to electronic sounds.  soon he found other pre- and proto-techno bands like <b>section 25</b>, <b>d.a.f.</b>, and <b>he said</b>, as well as industrial/atmospheric bands such as <b>einstürzende neubauten</b>, and <b>death in june</b>.  around 1986, chris began buying records like <b>cabaret voltaire</b>, <b>chris & cosey</b>, and <b>front 242</b>, and was further encouraged to buy records as a DJ on a campus radio station in massachusetts from 1987-89.  frequent trips to new york exposed him to the acid house explosion, and chris recalls a particularly memorable trip to DV8 in boston where there was a room of mysterious, minimal, non-vocal dance music...<br><br>

concurrent with his interest in technological music has been an interest in graphic design, especially the work of <b>vaughn oliver</b> and <b>neville brody</b>, which led him to take a prominent design job with the ohio state university's <b>wexner center for the arts</b>, a position he continues to hold today.<br><br>

in june of 1993, chris attended ele_mental's second event, entitled COMFORT, during which he became acquainted with <b>steven reaume</b>, a detroit native, who in turn showed chris the wealth of detroit techno which has had such an influence on today's dance music.  then, following the example of columbus' <b>body release</b> cru, chris began to amass the equipment necessary to create his own electronic music.  <br><br>

his early music was made at home and consisted of long, droning improvisations which seemed like an modern extension of <b>tangerine dream</b>.  slowly, chris accumulated both the equipment and the gear to start creating more cohesive musical structures, performing live at a small ele_mental house party in the spring of 1995, the 3rd ele_ment concert event, (Li): LITHIUM (march 1996), and most recently at the 8th ele_ment concert event (O): OXYGEN (may 1997).   he also finally wrote songs for <b>charles noel</b>'s 21/22 corporation, including one song called "gleek" (also his occasional DJ name) which appeared on the first "trace elements" vinyl compilation (sept 1996) and has attracted attention from artists such as <b>jay denham</b>, <b>rob hood</b>, <b>terry mullan</b> (who event put "gleek" on his first mix CD), and others.  <br><br>

his recent musical output has been rather quiet, but he has contributed to the design for "trace elements 3" as well as <b>t.j nagle</b>'s new label <b>residual</b>, and hopes to put together some tracks for an upcoming solo ep for the 21/22 corporation by mid-1998.
