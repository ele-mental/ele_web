(subtitled: WHY I RAVE *snicker*)<br>
<br>
well like a lot of people my age (mid-20s) i got into techno via the 
industrial route. MEAT BEAT and 808 did it for me, as well as the more 
ambient stuff of SWANS, THE CRANES, COCTEAU TWINS, etc all that 
lush-sounding 4A.D. stuff...<br>
<br>
now at that time, anywhere from 1989-1992, techno was not really split 
into too many categories...MEAT BEAT, YOUNG GODS, LFO, and ERASURE could 
often be found in the same section at the record store, for example... 
"techno" covered a lot of ground, from industrial to house to ambient. 
but the differentiation which has taken place since (jungle/hardcore/ 
acid/trax/trip-hop etc) is misleading, because even then, most of today's 
categories did exist (if unnamed and undeveloped). acid jazz/trip hop 
originally existed in the `70s, played on real instruments...of course 
then it was called "soul" or "free jazz" or "instrumental funk." electro, 
or "breakdance music" was often called "techno" and just as often not 
even differentiated from hip hop. acid and acid house existed as early as 
1986 (probably earlier, going back to disco!), but it was slower, and 
only a few people in chicago and other big city-clubs even knew about it. 
jungle existed, but it was a lot poppier and was called "break beat" or 
"hip house" (and it was often slow enough to even be mixed with house!). 
really hard industrial dance stuff existed, verging on gabber. etc.<br>
<br>
(ok, enough of that shit)<br>
<br>
i appreciated the more electronic side of things, and saw the difference 
between what was the house-culture influence of bands like DEE-LITE, as 
opposed to the teutonic-influenced NITZER EBB, for example, but i liked 
it all, even though my real exposure to the origins of those musics (on 
the one hand, club culture, and on the other, punk/industrial culture) 
was limited by where i am...columbus ohio. not too clubby or punky here 
:) <br>
<br>
in late 1991 i met titonton duvante, who was doing music with a band 
called BODY RELEASE. later i found out that an old industrial mate named 
charles noel was also with the band (todd sines and mike szebczek were 
the other two band members). BODY RELEASE sounded like a crossbreeding of 
LFO, old-skool breakbeat (esp REINFORCED), and house. i saw them play a 
couple times, liked them somewhat, but then i realized electronic music, 
and especially techno, was getting too "busy" for my taste. <br>
<br>
my turnoff point: in summer of 1992, i heard a song called "there is no 
law" and i just couldn't handle it. it was too fast, crazy, changed too 
much, and i knew i just wasn't ready for it. so i thought i was "over" 
techno and basically pulled out of what little scene there was for that 
kind of music, and went back to rock 'n' roll. (ok, ok, so sue me) <br>
<br>
at the same time, however, i worked with titonton on some new-agey type 
of music, playfully called DISCO BREAD, with me on guitar and him on 
keyboard, which we didnt take very seriously (especially with a name like 
THAT! :).<br>
<br>
but just from being over at that house (where the whole B/RE cru lived), 
i soaked up a lot of information which i had never really put together 
before. i saw the lineages through which techno could be traced: <br>
<br>
titonton was into early breaks and especially new classical stuff like 
MEREDITH MONK, PHILIP GLASS, and TERRY RILEY. charles came into techno 
through hip hop and house...and he never understood that what was so 
obvious to him (that house was a "black" thing to a great degree) was 
totally misunderstood by his own black culture (now, it's the opposite... 
the white kids don't realize how black techno is ;). todd was the one i 
most related to musically; he listened to a lot of "intelligent" 
industrial such as early P.I.L., COIL, etc... <br>
<br>
it made just as much sense to approach techno from titonton's minimal 
classical stuff as it did through hip hop as it did through industrial 
(of course i only really realized all of this JUST NOW AS I'M WRITING IT 
;). <br>
<br>
and they were _always_ playing breakbeat! especially off the REINFORCED 
label, and little by little i realized that that stuff had some of the 
same avant-garde flavor that i so admired in the dark music of the SWANS, 
THIS MORTAL COIL, etc...which i had been really into. the beat-cutting 
really woke me up because here was a music that was really taking 
sampling into new realms, like no other music (STILL) has really done. 
also, APHEX TWIN and SOURCE, which todd was playing a lot, led me to a 
deeper understanding of the lushness and beauty which techno could be 
capable of...<br>
<br>
now, as far as "raves" go i really didnt understand what the big deal 
was. it just seemed like another name for an afterhours. so when todd 
handed me a flyer for RAVIN BRAN in november 1992, in cleveland (where 
BODY RELEASE was playing), i just laughed and said "it's not worth 
driving up to cleveland for _that_."<br>
<br>
in early 1993 the B/RE cru threw a house party and i showed some nasty 
old stag films on the ceiling. the djs sucked but the party was still 
great because no real dj culture had really developed in columbus, 
outside of the clubs. so to hear everyone just faking it was a real great 
time (all except charles, who had been spinning hip hop since he was like 
13). i still didn't feel like i could "stoop" to the level of techno 
again, "it's a fad," i thought. but then i heard 2 songs that really 
changed my perspective: "zig zag" and "percolator." dude, this was 
_music_. these were minimal little dittys with jazz clips and truly 
innovative sounds... and man, i was hooked. little by little i started 
"getting" it, i kept finding more and more songs that i "understood." 
then i understood that the point of some techno IS to be totally obtuse 
and relentlessly repetitve; in fact the whole traxx/trance thing really 
started getting to me. and then all that "busy" stuff, embodied by the 
new spirit of breakbeat, which at first had almost literally scared me 
away from techno (!), also made sense. i loved it! <br>
<br>
but my first "real" rave wasn't until march of 1993, called FELICITY'S 
BLISS in cleveland. the only reason i went was because i was starting to 
do visuals for BODY RELEASE, showing silly films and such. it was a 
terrible party but interestingly, a band called BIG ENGINE played (2 
members of which are now in the ele mental posse: stephen/kingSize and 
rich/ihannoa). if i recall correctly, i really didn't get much into 
raving at all, except as the visual guy. the first party i think i went 
to just for the fun of it was CRYSTAL'S BIRTHDAY in dayton (gee, anyone 
remember THAT chestnut?). (on second thought i think i did some visuals 
for that party, but oh who cares)<br>
<br>
anyway, to move along here, i got into event-throwing soon after. 
basically this sculptor dude wanted us to use his space for a party and 
of course i saw it as a cool opportunity to make it a lot more 
artsy-fartsy than the silly parties i had already been to, but the 
sculptor dude went to a cheesy rave in town and said "uh, never mind." we 
said, "fuck it" and so todd found a parking garage and we threw our first 
party (where we got our name): ELE MENTAL, in may of 1993. dieselboy and 
a couple club djs spun, as well as titonton (who still didnt know how to 
spin) and charles... it was a great time. then we did a little bigger one 
called COMFORT in the summer of 1993, which turned out pretty nice (over 
500 ppl came!), but then shortly thereafter, something happened. <br>
<br>
the scene died.<br>
<br>
for months, it seemed that parties were barely happening. was the "fad" 
over? (well of course you know the answer) <br>
<br>
then BODY RELEASE broke up...everyone was doing their own thing and it 
was just no use trying to squeeze it all into one band. and altho the 
breakup was a positive one with lots of promise, the state of the scene 
raised serious questions about what might happen to techno...in other 
words, was it worth it?<br>
<br>
then THE VIBE IS ON happened in dayton in september of 1993, and it 
seemed like a culmination of sorts...an amazing party to end an era.<br> 
<br>
i often reflect on the significance of that moment where we all thought, 
here in columbus at least, that the scene was dead. what were we to do? 
titonton and i, at least, used to have conversations like "what will 
breaks sound like in 10 years?" the answer was unspeakable; we just 
_couldn't_ imagine it (the last 3 years have certainly born _that_ out, 
as jungle has gotten more and more out there...). but it was our own 
curiosity, our own need to find out what would happen, that forced us to 
keep hope.<br>
<br>
in december 1993, i spearheaded an event (for the first time), called 
SNOW*BALL (named by titonton). it was my own attempt to get ele mental 
back involved in the process...our statement to the world that we were 
here to STAY, at least long enough to find out where music was going to 
go, and with or without a "scene." the scene picked up bigtime soon after 
SNOW*BALL, and hasn't stopped since...in fact it's gotten bigger, more 
diverse, and more uncontrollable. ravers, more than ever, do NOT share a 
common experience, as there are too many parties in too many places on 
the same night.<br>
<br>
partially because of this, ele mental did not do a big event in 1994 at 
all. we did house parties and helped jj in kentucky a couple times, 
etc...but it just seemed like doing a party wasn't the same with so much 
going on. we also thought that with such a glut of events, and such an 
influx of the drug culture, that very few of these "ravers" could ever 
care about the things we cared (care) about.<br>
<br>
but we kept our faith, ultimately, through the smaller stuff, and because 
we saw what was going on in other cities. detroit was instrumental in 
this...especially dat and his POORBOY parties...i mean, if people in such 
a FUCKED UP CITY could do it, then why not us? the ILLUMINATORS also 
opened the doors for us, letting us spin and involving us in the 
process...coz they understood what was up, too (even tho they have yet to 
do a "weird" event ;). charles put out a couple tape compilations of 
columbus music called FUSION, which was yet another important statement: 
that columbus has MUSIC GOING ON and that you got to reco'nize, foo'... <br>
<br>
by luck of circumstance and finding a couple usable spaces, ele mental 
hit the big time in 1995 with kevin/placebo's MINIMAL STATE, me and aum 
with MANTRA, and doughboy's RED TEMPEST. charles released his own slab o 
vinyl. todd had something released on peace frog. more FUSION comps. so 
shit was starting to happen!<br>
<br>
but as far as the events go, again, they were ultimately unsatisfying... 
and _incredibly_ stressful. i tried to dig deeper at an untitled event on 
jun 30 but was hit so hard that i, for one, felt that the scene could not 
support the deeper kind of event i had in mind. <br>
<br>
now, the last 6 months have been the best we've had. why? we went 
smaller. we dug deeper. from august until last week, we've done almost 
_10_ free house parties, concerts, or small events. and we've all had a 
hell of a lot more fun doing them and being involved in them. less 
stress, less expectation, and also...more people have been getting the 
message and thanking us for it. also, more music has come out: 2 more by 
todd, one more by charles (self-released), and one by titonton (which 
people seem to especially like)...and an ambient tape compilation called 
TEXT 1 which i compiled...<br>
<br>
so what's the point of all of this? well, right now the scene (or the 
more appropriate phrase, "scene_S_") is at an all-time peak. you have all 
kinds of parties: house parties, small parties, big raves, and 
mega-corporate raves. we have a situation where the "consumers" outnumber 
the "appreciators." in other words more people are going to parties for 
reasons related to consumption: drugs, alcohol (in some cities), 
"prestige," to "fit in," or by pure accident. <br>
<br>
now i'm not saying this is exclusively bad, but it is harder for people 
in today's scene to really appreciate the true nature of the scene, or 
rather the deeper shit which i would say has to do with the music, djs, 
ppl that make the music, technology, visuals, the tribal gathering thing, 
self-discovery THRU drugs, and most especially: the grass-roots nature of 
the whole process. it is hard for "consumers" to appreciate these things 
when it is so easy for them to take the scene for granted. <br>
<br>
"there's always another party" is a typical attitude. well in mid-1993, 
the scene almost did die, let me tell you. (and in some ways it is always 
in danger of dying...)<br>
<br>
very few of the "consumers" are asking themselves just those questions 
that may lead them towards this deeper understanding, such as: "why am i 
a `raver'?" "who am i?" "what is _really_ going on here?" and VERY FEW 
promoters are making that extra effort towards providing an environment 
where this kind of dialogue and self-reflection can take place. <br>
<br>
my involvement in ele mental--as the loudest voice on the net and 
sometimes otherwise, as an event-thrower/designer, as a webpage designer, 
as a "raver" just out to have a great time--has been a slow but steady 
process of coming closer and closer to that understanding: the 
understanding of my (admittedly self-appointed) responsibility to try new 
ways of making this environment of self-discovery possible. <br>
<br>
THAT's what the events that i have spearheaded are all about. i'd say 
even the ones that weren't/aren't by me (such as MINIMAL STATE and RED 
TEMPEST, and GENERATOR coming up this april) have had/will have some of 
this aesthetic in mind.<br>
<br>
THAT's why i rave. THAT's why i throw events. THAT's why i post. THAT's 
why i did the webpages, for ele mental as well as mw-raves. to be an 
example of someone who loves the music and the scene so much that i'm 
willing to put my money and time where my mouth is. to do what i can to 
encourage that self-reflection, and not all the shadiness, frivolity, and 
excess of many other events/crus. and to give props where props are 
due...to the promoters, musicians, djs, and the people and history that 
has gotten us here...<br>
<br>
do i expect a big smooch? hell no...all i really want is for you, yes i 
mean YOU reading this right now, to ask yourself those deeper 
questions... and find your own answers. ele mental is not about 
preaching, it's about living by example. sometimes i do feel i have to 
preach and bitch and moan just to be heard, but so be it (maybe that's 
wrong, but sometimes i think it is necessary).<br>
<br>
so there you have it.<br>
<br>
and that, my net homeys, is what SNOW*FALL is all about. it's part 2 of 
SNOW*BALL, our appropriately-named party at the true beginning of our 
long road towards...ourselves.<br>
<br>
one more thing: i hate to turn this into a whole promo for the event, but 
SNOW*FALL is truly a collaboration between us all. several of us are 
putting up the necessary funds to get this all together, and almost all 
the people you see on the flyer or on the net post are PLAYING FOR FREE. 
that's right. todd sines and stephen/kingSize are playing for NOTHING, 
titonton, charles/monochrome, chris, placebo, doughboy, etc etc etc. and 
even the detroit cru which are our guests (shake, paris, billeebob, brian 
gillespie) are doing it for next-to-nothing because THEY understand, and 
in fact it was them who helped US through the downtime. we both owe each 
other a lot. and obviously this means that the people throwing it aren't 
making a dime...and if we do (an unlikely scenario), well, it's "payment" 
for doing all of this for free. <br>
<br>
so there. that's what my "rave" experience has been all about. <br>
<br>
i hope to see you here on fri, feb 2. :P <br>
<br>
and thanks if you read this far, yer a real trooper if ya did ;) <br>
<br>
(more later)<br>
