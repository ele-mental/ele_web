<br>
PLUR is just an acronym; nothing more or less than a _symbol_ for things
which everyone should already be working for in our scene and in the
outside world...this takes WORK, WORK, and more WORK, so stop blabbin
"PLUR! PLUR! PLUR!!" like an idiot and let's come up with some _concrete_
ways of acting on the words which make up that acronym...as well as
dealing with a whole host of other words and concepts (positive and
negative) like "trust," "integrity," "racism," "sexism," "specieism,"
"cultural appropriation," "history," "representation," and so on...which 
very few of us on this list seem willing to try.<br>
<br>
"PLUR everyone!!"<br>
<br>
(woops that's two sentences)<br>
