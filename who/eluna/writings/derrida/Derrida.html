      Jacques Derrida is among the most quoted philosophical thinkers to emerge 
      in the last thirty years. His vast body of work -- clear and well-articulated 
      in its intention but opaque and eruditic in its style -- has been eagerly 
      taken up by the fields of architecture, cultural criticism, media studies, 
      literary criticism, anthropology, the philosophy of science, performance 
      studies, film studies, and various other disciplines -- all claiming post-structuralism 
      as worthy of investigation.<br>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <br>
      Yet his relevance to dance has scarcely been traced. This brief essay attempts 
      to address the little-explored convergence between Derrida's thought and 
      the discipline of dance, by an examination of some of his basic contributions 
      to our current cultural and philosophical climate. I am drawing primarily 
      from excerpts from two of his seminal texts: "Structure, Sign, and Play 
      in the Discourse of the Human Sciences" (from <i>Contemporary Literary Criticism</i>, 
      2nd edition. Robert Con Davis and Ronald Schleifer, editors; Longman, New 
      York, 1989); and "Diff&eacute;rance" (from <i>Speech and Phenomena, and 
      Other Essays on Husserl's Theory of Signs</i>, translated by David B. Allison; 
      Evanston IL, Northwestern University Press, 1973); plus a third source about 
      Derrida by Christopher Johnson, simply entitled <i>Derrida</i> (The Great 
      Philosophers, consulting editors Ray Monk and Frederic Raphael; Phoenix, 
      London, 1998), subtitled <i>The Scene of Writing</i>, examining Derrida's 
      1967 book <i>Of Grammatology</i> (translated by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, 
      Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976).<br>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <br>
        Derrida's work tends to coalesce around a series of concerns: namely, 
        those of identity, writing, interpretation, signification, deconstruction, 
        and <i>diff&eacute;rance</i>. I am concentrating in this paper on the 
        concept of <i>diff&eacute;rance</i> and its many implications, which will 
        reveal something about his other concerns in the process.<br>
        <br>
      <i>Diff&eacute;rance</i> is a peculiar play on words which is untranslatable 
      in English. It takes on the meaning of the English word "difference" but 
      adds to it an important temporal sense of "deferral," which, as Derrida 
      himself says, "puts off until 'later' what is presently denied."<font size="1"><a href="#1">1</a></font> 
      <i>Diff&eacute;rance</i> is "neither a <i>word</i> nor a <i>concept</i>"<a href="#2"><font size="1">2</font></a> 
      but rather a strategy for understanding, or rather, revealing that which 
      is imperceptible. Derrida sets this non-word, non-concept to the task of 
      articulating, and extending in a radical way, Saussure's understanding of 
      language as a system of differences "without positive terms." Saussure, 
      it should be recalled, contributed to the foundation of structuralism with 
      his notion that language is a system, "in which it is the relations between 
      elements and not the elements themselves that are responsible for meaning"<font size="1"><a href="#3">3</a></font>. 
      In short, <i>diff&eacute;rance</i> is Derrida's way of expanding Saussure's 
      theory to its logical end:<br>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        <br>
        </font> 
      <table width="100%" border="0">
        <tr> 
          <td width="8%" height="65">&nbsp;</td>
          <td width="92%" height="65"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
            first consequence to be drawn from this is that the signified concept 
            is never present to itself, in an adequate presence that would only 
            refer to itself. Every concept is necessarily and essentially inscribed 
            in a chain or a system, within which it refers to another and to other 
            concepts, by the systematic play of differences. Such a play, then 
            -- <i>diff&eacute;rance</i> -- is no longer simply a concept, but 
            the possibility of conceptuality, of the conceptual system and process 
            in general.<a href="#4"><font size="1">4</font></a></font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Thus, if concepts are 
      chained so resolutely as Derrida claims, no concept exists which is not 
      (always) already part of a chain. In other words (and this is much in line 
      with structuralist reasoning) there is no possibility of a concept existing 
      <i>outside</i> the system; it is always (already) part of a system of differentiation 
      which both defines it and fails to define it at the same time. This is where 
      <i>diff&eacute;rance</i> &quot;exists,&quot; if indeed it can be said to 
      "exist" at all -- not at the center, nor at the not-center, but at the place 
      of <i>diff&eacute;rance</i> itself.<br>
      <br>
      But Derrida is not content to merely overturn one of the founding tenets 
      of western philosophy -- the self-evidence of the origin, and self-presence 
      (outlined by Aristotle and Bertrand Russell, among others)<font size="1"><a href="#5">5</a></font> 
      -- for he goes on to immediately reinstate it, in a completely different 
      way:<br>

          <td width="92%" height="53"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
            we note as <i>diff&eacute;rance</i> will thus be the movement of play 
            that "produces" (and not by something that is simply an activity) 
            these differences, these effects of difference&#133; <i>Diff&eacute;rance</i> 
            is the nonfull, nonsimple "origin"; it is the structured and differing 
            origin of differences.<font size="1"><a href="#6">6</a></font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><br>
      The relevance of this concept to he field of dance scholarship will merely 
      be alluded to here, but it is enough to ask whether or not iterations of 
      the body, grounded in particular vocabularies of movement, have suffered 
      from a similarly short-sighted understanding of presence and self-evidence 
      -- performance is clearly not evident, if it depends on other bodies (or 
      viewers) to prove its existence, which in turn depends on other bodies (or 
      viewers), and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. Yet, at the same time, dance seems 
      to instinctively draw from the productive possibilities of playing with 
      the spatial and temporal thereness of a body (i.e., its presence), while 
      simultaneously celebrating its non-presence, or the immediate <i>disappearance</i> 
      of a performance after it has traced its lines through space and time. [This 
      will be elaborated more fully below.]<br>
      <br>
      Here it is worth considering Derrida's notion of <i>inaudibility</i>, where 
      "the <i>a</i> of <i>diff&eacute;rance</i>&#133;is not heard; it remains 
      silent, secret, and discreet, like a tomb." In this case, Derrida moves 
      to an examination of graphical manifestations of language, i. e., writing. 
      He argues that the distinction between "diff&eacute;r<i>e</i>nce" and "diff&eacute;r<i>a</i>nce" 
      can only be made through writing; in French, the distinction is inaudible. 
      Moreover, Derrida tells us that<br>
      <br>
      </font>
      <table width="100%" border="0">
        <tr> 
          <td width="8%" height="21">&nbsp;</td>
          <td width="92%" height="21"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">this 
            silence that functions only within what is called phonetic writing&#133;points 
            out or reminds us in a very opportune way that, contrary to an enormous 
            prejudice, there is no phonetic writing&#133; The difference that 
            brings out phonemes and lets them be heard and understood [<i>entendre</i>] 
            itself remains inaudible.<font size="1"><a href="#7">7</a></font> 
            </font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><br>
      To summarize this rather surprising statement, the difference between "diff&eacute;r<i>e</i>nce" 
      and "diff&eacute;r<i>a</i>nce" cannot be accounted for audibly, yet it exists 
      nonetheless. If that is the case, then the claim that writing is merely 
      a recording of speech -- the supposed originary mode of communication -- 
      is incorrect. Writing therefore, has a primacy that has been heretofore 
      unacknowledged, which leads Derrida to conclude that the distinction between 
      writing, a graphic representation, and speech, an audible flow, is not as 
      clear as most philosophical inquiry has long assumed. Among the many implications 
      Derrida draws out from this is an expansion of the very notion of writing. 
      For Derrida, as Christopher Johnson summarizes, <br>
      <br>
      </font>
      <table width="100%" border="0">
        <tr> 
          <td width="8%" height="41">&nbsp;</td>
          <td width="92%" height="41"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
            <font size="2">Writing in the general sense of the term extends beyond 
            even the widest definition of empirical systems of writing; rather 
            it is the condition of possibility of writing in the common sense 
            of the term, and indeed of language in general.<a href="#8"><font size="1">8</font></a></font></font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><br>
      Expanding this idea even farther, Johnson states that<br>

          <td width="8%" height="41">&nbsp;</td>
          <td width="92%" height="41"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 
            this structural and historical perspective, the question of <i>where</i> 
            and <i>when</i> writing begins&#133;becomes superfluous, or at best, 
            relative. Derrida's conception of writing defamiliarizes the customary 
            distinctions made between speech and writing, life and death, presence, 
            and absence, the human and the animal, the human and the technological, 
            and emphasizes instead their necessary co-implication and continuity.<a href="#9"><font size="1">9</font></a></font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><br>
      In this light, let us take another look at the defamiliarizing, decentering 
      effects generated by <i>diff&eacute;rance</i>, in relation to dance. In 
      "Structure, Sign, and Play," Derrida begins to defamiliarize us with the 
      center in terms of "substitution":<br>
      <br>
      </font>
      <table width="100%" border="0">
        <tr> 
          <td width="8%" height="41">&nbsp;</td>
          <td width="92%" height="41"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
            <font size="2">The substitute does not substitute itself for anything 
            which has somehow existed before it. Henceforth, it was necessary 
            to begin thinking that there was no center, that the center could 
            not be thought in the form of a present-being, that the center had 
            no natural site, that it was not a fixed locus but a function, a sort 
            of nonlocus in which an infinite number of sign-substitutions came 
            into play.<a href="#10"><font size="1">10</font></a></font></font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><br>
      At the risk of misappropriating Derrida's very specific (and highly context-bound) 
      argument, let us consider what this substitution might mean in terms of 
      the performing body. In dance performance, the dancer often takes on a kind 
      of "character" (or "character of movement"), substituting what is presumably a self-present consciousness 
      with a kind of "non-consciousness" that takes over and motivates movement. 
      Yet if this character is merely a replacement 
      for a present performer, or if the performer somehow has to set aside a 
      "true self" in the act of taking on this character or choreography, it implies that the 
      "true self" has, within itself, the <i>condition of possibility</i> of untruth, 
      and therefore of some degree of replaceability. So again, in affirming the 
      opposition between presence and non-presence, we find that the distinction 
      in not as clear as we once thought (this defamiliarization/destabilization 
      is, in effect, deconstruction at work).<br>
      <br>
      Here, I am tempted to exaggerate the implication that 
      a performer engaged in a performance might not thus be the "center," a moving 
      body in space, and is, instead, merely a "function," or "nonlocus" ("nonpresence"). 
      Despite the apparent extremity of this view, dance scholar (and Frankfurt Ballet 
      collaborator) Heidi Gilpin might agree:<br>
      <br>
      </font>
      <table width="100%" border="0">
        <tr> 
          <td width="8%" height="29">&nbsp;</td>
          <td width="92%" height="29"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
            <font size="2">We can never know what took place [in a performance], 
            because the image etched in memory is transformed the moment we attempt 
            o reexamine it. Performance, through its embodiment of absence, in 
            is enactment of disappearance, can only leave traces for us to search 
            between, among, beyond.<a href="#11"><font size="1">1</font></a></font><a href="#11"><font size="1">1</font></a></font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> <br>
      The "loss" of performance, or its immediate disappearance as it enters our 
      awareness, is similar to Derrida's comments on "the absent origin," of <i>diff&eacute;rance</i>, 
      but he also goes on to say that there is indeed more than just "the saddened, 
      negative, nostalgic, guilty, Rousseauistic side of the thinking"<a href="#12"><font size="1">12</font></a> 
      -- indeed, there exists<br>
      <br>
      </font>

          <td width="8%" height="47">&nbsp;</td>
          <td width="92%" height="47"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the 
            joyous affirmation of the play of the world and of the innocence of 
            becoming, the affirmation of a world of signs without fault, without 
            truth, and without origin which is offered to an active interpretation.13</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><br>
      Moreover, if we are doomed to "interpret" the moment we perceive a dance, 
      we are at least offered two kinds of interpretation: one, which "dreams 
      of deciphering a truth or an origin which escapes play and the order of 
      the sign," and the other, which "is no longer turned toward the origin, 
      affirms play and tries to pass beyond man and humanism&#133;" Navigating 
      between these opposite modes, Derrida suggests, is not so much a matter 
      of choice as it is a way to "conceive of the common ground, and the differance 
      of this irreducible difference."<a href="#14"><font size="1">14</font></a><br>
      <br>
      In other words, as viewers and interpreters of dance, we must not be paralyzed 
      by our inability to capture the essence of a performance that has just happened 
      before our very eyes. Instead, we must acknowledge the irreconcilable but 
      equally valid truths embedded in <i>diff&eacute;rance</i>; that even as 
      we interpret a dance, we are closing off and denying possible avenues of 
      interpretation, but at the same time we are also generating and affirming 
      new interpretations that may expand the scope of interpretation, and dance 
      in general. <br>
      <br>
      In closing this (all to brief) essay, I would like to call attention to 
      a final suggestion from Derrida, where he asks that we not turn our eyes 
      away<br>
