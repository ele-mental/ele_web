<b>info::</b><br>

edward luna was born in columbus ohio where he has remained most of his
life (with the exception of briefs stays in mexico and california).  his
involvement with what was to be called ele_mental began in the fall of
1992, and his growing friendship with <a href="../titonton/">titonton
duvante</a>, who (re)exposed him to the sounds of underground dance music
and fostered an appreciation of the connections between this music and
older forms of music such as classical minimalism.  soon he was showing
super-8 films at house parties organized by the <b>body release</b> crew
(including <b>todd sines</b> and <b>charles noel</b>), and becoming more
and more involved in the band's live shows.  this eventually led to the
event which named them--the first ele_mental event, on sat 18 may 93,
called simply <b>ele_mental</b>.  this word was selected by ed (partially
inspired by a song entitled "the elements," by <b>reinforced</b> stalwarts
<b>4 hero</b>), and split into two words by todd sines ("for no apparent
reason" ).<br><br>

after several events organized primarily by todd, ed took the reins
himself and became the instigator of most of ele_mental's smaller and more
conceptual events.  ed remains the only person in the cru who has the time
to devote to consistent event-coordination, thanks to the patience and
love of his parents who have supported his decision to remain at home in
the hope of building something by sheer devotion and hard work.  [much of
the remaining history of ele_mental events can be found in the <a
href="../../what.was/">what.was</a> section]<br><br>

ed's primary intention in presenting events is to attempt a re-definition
of the party or "rave" experience, injecting a healthy dose of artistry
into the mix, and presenting a consistent overarching aesthetic based on
minimalism, technology, conceptualism, and structural awareness.  ed is
attempting to do this by keeping things locally-oriented, cheap, and
accessible to people of various backgrounds, while also involving those
special artists, composers, and DJs who share in the ideals of ele_mental
or appreciate them.  the voicemail, webpages, and writings are all a part
of an overall scheme which attempts to tie all of these things together
into a cohesive and versatile unit.<br><br>

in his DJ incarnation as<b>lunar</b> (beginning in late 1993), ed has 
attempted to take the traditional DJ set into more conceptual areas, 
creating immersive sound environments that incorporate almost every genre 
of electronic and experimental music, with an overarching belief that 
through the power of tones, the mind will open.  he has closed at 
larger events such as GENERATOR, and has frequently worked with the 
<b>justus</b> crew of dayton who have encouraged him by hiring his 
services to create ambient/experimental rooms at various events 
(notably, at EPT in december 1996, and RESONATE in sept 1997). <br><br>

his most recent experiment with sound is a drastic re-thinking of the 
traditional DJ set, a project known as <b>first sequence</b>.  in this 
incarnation, the properties of the vinyl recording are overturned, making 
the actual vinyl itself the medium of both sound transport AND 
production.  in one example, <b>first sequence</b> claims the final locked
groove at the end of most vinyl recordings as the beginning of sound, not 
the end.  it is from the minute pops and clicks heard at the ends of 
these records that <b>first sequence</b> begins, mixing these sounds (all 
of them different, depending on when and where the records were cut) into 
new configurations in a similar way to the moment when DNA first began to 
replicate itself.  other experiments in the use of vinyl as music are 
forthcoming...<br><br>
