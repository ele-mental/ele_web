<b>info::</b><br><br>

<b>aaron shinn</b>'s musical upbringing was shaped partially by the electronic music of his father, <b>eric shinn</b> (who has been working with electronic music for over a decade, and who also started the <b>columbus midi user's group</b>), as well as earlier forms of electronic dance music such as electro, hip hop, and electronic-industrial.<br><br>

his involvement in the electronic music scene began around 1992, at a very early age of 14, when his friend <b>todd faulkner</b> began to expose him to all kinds of dance music, which led him to discover the early sounds of breakbeat, especially <b>the prodigy</b>.  he eventually began to buy lots of music, first on CD, then vinyl, and had several awkward DJ gigs in 1992 (as DJ <b>andromeda</b>) before meeting several key people in the columbus electronic music scene, including the members of columbus' pioneer techno band <b>body release</b> (feat. <b>titonton duvante</b>, <b>todd sines</b>, and <b>charles noel</b>), and fellow breakbeat enthusiast <b>kevy kev</b>.  inspired by these examples, aaron then began to take advantage of his father's musical gear to make music of his own.<br><br>

his musical experimentation and abstract approach to jungle culminated in the "eye of the storm" cassette EP (under the name of <b>ghost</b>), a very powerful work that incorporated abstract beats with japanese animation samples.  he carried the cassette with him on a short trip to the home of jungle­­london england­­in september of 1995, during which he met several jungle composers such as <b>dego</b> (of reinforced) and <b>adam f</b> (from section 5), who greatly inspired and encouraged him.<br><br>

however, aaron then entered a period of musical frustration.   during this time he performed live at a small ele_mental house party in june of 1996, playing unfinished fragments of jungle songs, and proving that he had progressed a great deal in his ideas, but for aaron, jungle by itself simply wasn't the only direction he wanted to go.  so in 1997, he began to incorporate some live elements into his music, sampling himself playing various instruments and taking his ideas into other realms.<br><br>

his live performance at ele_mental's 8th ele_ment concert event entitled OXYGEN (16 may 97) was the culmination of this process, featuring various songs written for a conceptual solo CD project as well as a few selections written expressly for the event.  this performance, along with a show at cleveland's <b>speak in tongues</b> (entitled FIND, presented by our friends known as <b>neveron</b>) were well-received and were his final live performances to date.
<br><br>

his next project was <b>tentochi</b> (a japanese word meaning "heaven and earth") in collaboration with <b>todd faulkner</b>, performing live space/drone/ambient music numerous times at ele_mental's monday night MENTAL event throughout the summer of 1997, with return engagements in columbus throughout the winter of 97-98.  the <b>tentochi</b> project culminated in a beautifully-packaged CD which compiled the best of their live performances of mid-1997.  the CD is still available (email <a href="mailto:ashinn@artic.edu">aaron</a> to get more info).<br><br>

in late summer 1997, aaron moved to chicago to attend the art institute of chicago, where he has continued to explore electronic forms, whether in music or print design.  he has returned to columbus on several occasions and has continued to spin as <b>andromeda</b> throughout the great lakes area.<br>
