<b>info::</b><br>

todd sines arrived in columbus from elyria, ohio, in 1991.  his musical exploration had begun with his involvement in high school experimental rock bands, emphasizing textural qualities (like those of MY BLOODY VALENTINE and COCTEAU TWINS) while maintaini
ng a darker, harsher edge.  his interest in music was concurrent with an interest in graphic design, and early on (throughout 1992-93), todd compiled a small 'zine called "visual razor blade," that contained interviews with experimental electronic musicia
ns (among other things) and allowed him to develop strong design sense which has never left him.  he also became interested in the noisier aspects of industrial music such as ZOVIET FRANCE and the hip-hop elements of MEAT BEAT MANIFESTO.  in fall of 1991,
 todd and mike szebczek began BODY RELEASE, and added <a href="../titonton/">titonton duvante</a> and <a href="../cnoel/">charles noel</a> soon thereafter.  todd also fell in love with cleaner music of the british "intelligent techno" movement (such as BL
ACK DOG, LFO, and B12), was inspired by the sound manipulations of APHEX TWIN, and even soaked up the music of REINFORCED (thanks to titonton and charles). 
<br><br>

in may of 1993 todd spearheaded an art-oriented techno event along with the B/Re cru and friends, named ELE_MENTAL (a name selected by <a href="../eluna/">ed luna</a> which todd split into two parts).  after another event entitled COMFORT in jun 93, todd 
distanced himself from the event-throwing side of things to concentrate on graphic design and music, but the ele_mental concept has continued until today.<br><br>

todd's solo music commenced in 1994 as ENHANCED, with a track on the compilation "elements of and experiments with sound" on carl craig's label planet e out of detroit.  then, through a friendship with DAN BELL, todd released work in 1995 as .X TRAK on the UK's peace frog label and dan's own 7th city label.  recently, todd has released some music as TRAIT through HYPERACTIVE's label contact out of chicago, and is featured on the "deeper shades of techno" compilation (along with titonton) compiled by the
REINFORCED boys, DEGO and MARK MAC.<br><br>
as a graphic design artist, todd has done art for various record labels including <a href="http://www.mich.com/~planete/">planet e</a>, environ, <a href="http://www.hyperreal.com/~lunar/7th.city.html">7th city</a>, and most recently, <a href="../../21/">the 21/22 corporation</a>.<br><br>

other recent activities included graduation, marriage, and the initiation of <a href="http://hyperreal.com/~sines/">core communications</a> which is the barest beginnings of a graphic-design and visual/interactive entity.
