<b>info::</b><br>

well it is a well-known fact that doug grew up on heavy metal and was a 
skater for a while, he's also been part of the cru just about as long as 
anyone can remember.  doug basically just started showing up consistently 
at BODY RELEASE gigs and helped out in whatever way he could.  eventually 
this led him to DJing, and in fact doug was one of the first ele_mentals 
to start spinning seriously, and he bought DJ equipment very early on 
(many of us learned on this system).  most of his early purchases 
consisted of gabber and jungle, but eventually he became more 
interested in hard trax.<br><br>

at some point doug decided to get his own event together, which ended up
being <a href="../../what.was/events/red.tempest.gif">RED TEMPEST</a> in
may of 1995.  he went on to throw <a
href="../../what.was/events/gen.flyer.gif">GENERATOR</a> in april 1996 in
much the same vein, and after a lot of work he became the resident DJ at
<b>mekka</b>, hosting the sunday night techno night for a year and a half. 
recently, doug was be found in charge of a wednesday night techno night at
<b>maxwell's</b>, and has most recently established his own production entity called <b>pitch control productions</b>, to continue his exploration of the traxxier/techno side of dance music.
