<b>info::</b><br>

kevin kennedy's musical history began in the early '80s, in the 4th grade,
when he began to play the clarinet and learn how to read music.  his
interest in electronic music was the result of the music he heard all
around him, especially the sounds of electro and hip-hop, and later, house
and techno.  combined with an appreciation of the heaviness of LED
ZEPPELIN, the multiple personas of DAVID BOWIE, the experimentation of
SONIC YOUTH, and the bounciness of reggae, kevin's musical journey led him
to join the eclectic funk/hip-hop/fusion band THE POETS OF HERESY, which
was founded in 1989.  meanwhile, his exposure to the newer electronic
dance music of bands such as LFO caused him to re-examine techno, and
along with the influence ofcColumbus' BODY RELEASE (todd sines, mike
czebczek, titonton duvante, and charles noel), and the experimental
sampling syncopations of jungle (especially the REINFORCED label) drew
kevin closer to DJing and doing his own techno, which he began to do in
1994 as POWERHOUSE. <br><br>

by 1995 kevin was heavily involved with the ele_mental ideal on various
levels, and has continued to be one of the most ardent supporters of that
ideal, which also helped him forge strong connections with detroit's dan
bell and Illinois electronic alchemist dac crowell.  more recently, kevin
has honed his live performance skills at an ele_mental house party, at
))JOIN(( in april of 1996, at two events by dayton's premier
promotional group, JUSTUS, at the 7th ele_ment concert event (N): 
NITROGEN (28 mar 97), and his highest-profile gig at A HARD BLACK 
EVENING (20 jun 97), presented by the kalamazoo MI posse of <b>black nation 
records</b> with whom he has forged a strong friendship.  through 
these live shows, kevin has raised his profile, allowing him to explore
new ideas.  he has also contributed a song to the TRACE ELEMENTS 2 vinyl
ep for the 21/22 corporation, and has releasing a vinyl ep as THE SLEEP
ENGINEER, through the Xplor sublabel of Derrick Thompson's Soiree Records
from Detroit.
