<b>info::</b><br><br>

<b>rich ratvasky</b>, originally from newcastle, PA, began his journey through sound in the mid 1980s, with simple, cassette-based experimental electronic compositions.   along with <b>jeff hindman</b>, rich founded the techno/industrial band <b>big engine</b> in 1987, which later included younger brother <b>stephen hindman</b> (aka <b>kingsize</b>).<br><br>

rich's interest in complex layers of unusual sounds came from listening to bands such as <b>meat beat manifesto</b> and <b>skinny puppy</b>; and just as industrial dance music took a turn towards the rave phenomenon, so did <b>big engine</b>, as rich himself took part in the growth of the rave scene in northeast ohio throughout the early 1990s.  through the rave experience, rich learned the power of dance music, and the music of such bands as <b>the orb</b>, <b>orbital</b>, and <b>f.s.o.l</b>, whose recombinations of synthetic and organic sounds impressed him greatly.  <br><br>

with the dissolution of <b>big engine</b>, rich began to concentrate almost fully on his own music, and he soon moved to columbus where he came into contact with the ele_mentals. his first musical contribution was a song for the <b>fusion</b> series of tape compilations, released through <b>charles noel</b>'s <b>21/22 corporation</b> in 1994.  as his artist name, he took the name of his guardian spirit, <b>ihannoa</b>, discovered through a ouija board.  this began a collaboration with the ele_mentals which has lasted until the present day, a relationship that has involved his enthusiastic participation in several live performances; most notably, at two previous ele_ment concert events, (H): HYDROGEN (august `95) and (B): BORON (august `96), and (PHYLOS) in may of this year.  another highlight has been the inclusion of his song "linked" on the "trace elements 2" vinyl compilation ep by the 21/22 corporation.<br><br>

rich's keen sense of sound results in music that contains many complex, interacting layers that come together seamlessly.  expect him to continue to make his invaluable musical contribution to ele_mental events and musical releases.
