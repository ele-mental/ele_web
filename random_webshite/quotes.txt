after silence, the thing that closest expresses the inexpressable is
music" -Aldous Huxley

"You do not need to leave your room.  Remain sitting at your table
and listen.  Do not even listen, simply wait, be quiet still and
solitary.  The world will freely offer itself to you to be unmasked,
"it has no choice, it will roll in ecstasy at your feet"
-franz kafka

Which is more musical: a truck passing by a factory or a truck passing by
a music school?" --John Cage
