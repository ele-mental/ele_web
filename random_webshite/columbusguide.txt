ELECTRONIC MUSIC IN COLUMBUS [and beyond]
An Incomplete Guide


The infinitely diverse sounds of electronic music can be found in many
places here in Columbus.  Whether you're looking to sort through the many
genres of electronic music for the first time, or whether you already know
what you like, Columbus has something to offer you.  First of all, there
are many levels to the local electronic music scene: from flashy dance
clubs, to all-night raves, experimental underground events, casual cafe
nights, and the occasional outdoor electronic music gathering.  Columbus
is also the home of a dozen electronic music producers, promotional
groups, and even a handful of record labels.  Several record stores also
specialize in electronic music, and a few hours a week are devoted to
electronic music on the radio airwaves.  A number of websites also contain
great information (and sometimes sounds) to help you along.  No matter
where you start, you're sure to find something you like.  This guide is
only the beginning.

RAVE AND ELECTRONIC MUSIC EVENT PROMOTERS

Raves are inherently a fly-by-night phenomenon, promoted mostly within the
rave culture itself, through flyers and telephone-based voicelines.  As
such, the rave culture may seem --- to outsiders.  But sometimes, a rave
is the only place to immerse yourself in a crowd of people who love
electronic dance music, so give it a try.  

The following promotional groups all represent different ideals and
musical tastes.  Some throw more events than others.  Find out what
they're all about by giving them a call and listening to what their
voiceline has to say.

Collective Intelligence: 470-3839
ele_mental: 470-0929
Tri Quad: 470-2105
Surreal: 792-8850

OSU's low-key, student-run station, called The Underground (91.3 FM???),
features several weekly shows focused on electronic music.  Due to the
lack of an FCC license, however, The Underground can only be heard a short
distance away from campus, but don't worry: they also simulcast their
signal on the internet at ???

BOOKS ABOUT ELECTRONIC MUSIC

Altered States (1997?), by

Generation Ecstacy (1998), by Simon Reynolds.

The History of House (1997?), by ???

Multiple Meaning, Techno: A Political Laboratory of the Present (1998), by
Michel Gaillot.
An extremely dense academic book about the politics of Techno (and
electronic dance music in general).  Very rewarding to the patient and
advanced reader.

Look in your local library for more books on older electronic forms such
as Techno-Pop, Krautrock, Psychedelic Rock, academic electronic music,
Musique Concrete, and early electronic instruments such as the Theremin
and the Trautonium.  Also, if you think women have not played a part in
the growth and development of electronic music, here's a few names you
should research: Clara Rockmore, Pril Smiley, Alice Shields, Pauline
Oliveros, Wendy Carlos, Donna Summer, Paris Grey, Dajae, Andrea Parker,
Neotropic, Laura Grabb, Heather Heart, The Punisher, Miss Djax, Akilah
Bryant, Kelli Hand, and many others. 

Meanwhile, the history of electronic music is still in the making...
