TONY RAMOS began using computers in 1981, at the age of 13, thanks to the
public school system of Lorrain, Ohio.  After years of working with
technology while listening to electro, hip-hop, and industrial dance
music, Tony eventually ended up hanging out with the BODY RELEASE cru in
1993, doing visuals for the band and helping out in whatever way he could. 
He would become an originator of the ele_mental ideal--to present
challenging, artistic, and fun electronic music events at a cheap price. 
Tony has continued to contribute his time to ele_mental events on many
occasions, setting up conceptual interactive areas such as "game rooms"
with old video games, computer-mediated environments such as live net
connections, and visual enhancements such as live video feedback and film
loops, always looking for new ideas to explore.
