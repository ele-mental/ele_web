SHO

SHO KUWAMOTO finds his origins inextricably linked to the midwest, having
established himself in the midwest scene during his long --- towards a phd
in physics at purdue university, lafayette indiana.  his heady mix of
klangy techno was well-received and it was this mindset that he took with
him when the river of life swept him out to san francisco in 1995.  as a
founding member of the MAD cru, SHO has continued to sling his dark,
bleepy, black slabs of wax in the techno-deprived bay area, at the weekly 
MAD event, and at --- .  we welcome his return visit to the area that made
him...
