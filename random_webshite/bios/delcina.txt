DELCINA makes her DJ debut at this ele_ment event.  a westerville
resident, del is a new DJ who has only recently begun to feel confident
enough to play out.  her primary influences range from the heavy-headed
hard house of chicago, as well as other chicago-oriented styles such as
booty trax and deep house.  the new phenomenon of speed garage has also
attracted her attention, so expect to hear a wide variety from our latest
local turntablist.
