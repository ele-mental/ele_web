BAMBULE--MEANS--RESISTANCE.  Formed within seminal noise explorers
CINDYTALK (over 15 years ago, London England).  BAMBULE--transmitting
distorted vocal messages/disrupted codes: "The fountain will be silent
until the wind sighs."  "Fallen monuments have become our brothers &
sisters."  "Nothing is true, everything is repeated."  Inspired by the
radical politics of Ulrike Meinhoff and the Red Army Faction (Germany).
Textural distortion and mischeivous beats: released through Praxis London
("Cunning Meets Bambule": Praxis 19 2x12 doublepack, "Let One Hundred
Flowers Bloom": Praxis 29, soon to be released).  Currently based in
Columbus. 

"The Urban Guerrilla's Aim is to attack the state's apparatus of control
at certain points and put them out of action to destroy the myth of the
system's omnipresence and invulnerability." --extract from "The Concept of
the Urban Guerrilla," Red Army Faction.
