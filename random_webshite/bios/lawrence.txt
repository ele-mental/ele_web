LAWRENCE BLACK has been an attendee at many an ele_mental event, and has
always seemed enthusiastic to explore what we have to offer.  now,
lawrence returns the favor by playing his own brand of lush, smooth, and
hip-hop influenced drum'n'bass music for us.  as a DJ for just over a year
now, lawrence seeks a kind of drum'n'bass music that is rich in atmosphere
but heavy on the breakbeats.  his subtle scratching style evolved from an
old-school setup he used as a youngster, but now that he's got the
cadillacs of turntables, technics 1200s, so scratching is made much
easier.  lawrence also hopes to incorporate a live, MC-syle, vocal element
to his sets, and this event may be just the right place for him to
continue with the such experimentation...
