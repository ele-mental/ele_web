1. How did the ele_mental first come together?

The core of ele_mental was formed shortly after Body Release disbanded in
early 1993. b|re consisted of Titonton Duvante, Charles Noel, and myself.
Ed Luna, Dave Miller, Tony Ramos, and Mike Brown were all pivotal elements
at the time when we through our first party on 21 May 1993, self titled
"ele mental" at an OSU parking garage. Other local DJs, artists, computer
geeks, and musicians soon drifted into the orbit.


2. What were the major obstacles you all faced when you first started
throwing parties?

Finding spaces, defeating the Columbus curfew and "No Dancing After 2am"
law, getting people to play for us despite not being well-known, and
the stigma of short-lived clubs and promoters going out of 'business' or
just falling out of the scene.

Oh yeah, getting busted and _dealing_ with the consequences. *grin --ED!*

3. Does the Ohio scene live up to the standards that you place on it?
Why/Why not

I still feel most at home here, despite growing up in Cleveland. If anything,
I think we are more like a sister city to Detroit, and therefore we attempt
to place those kind of standards upon it. Considering that some of us have
recording for 'detroit'  and 'detroit-style' labels such as Frictional, 7th
City, Planet E, etc, I think we are doing quite well, not only for Columbus,
but Ohio as well [Dan Curtin, Morgan Geist, and Mike Filly.]

4. What are the major artistic and visionary ideals that ele_mental have?

I have always thought of ourselves as a reinterpretation of the dadaist and
modernist art movements of the 20's and 30's. By this, I mean the Bauhaus,
Marcel Duchamp, Kasimir Malevich, Luis Bunuel. Etc. In addition, the work of
4AD and v23 envelope has inspired the connection between image and sound. You
can then reinterpret that as the sound of image, and the image of sound. The
lines are not terribly clear, and I think it is better that way. In the
future, I would like to return to a cohesive concept approach, where all of
the elements behind a release, event, or experience is a multisensory and
multidisciplinary journey.

5. Do you find that the scene is still revolutionary or do you think the
ideals that ele_mental believe in don't have a direction to go now?

The 'scene' will always be revolutionary as long as people keep producing
and enjoying music. I think that the scene goes through a catharsis every
couple years, weeding out those no longer interested, and bringing aboard
new faces along the way.

6. Do any of you produce? Who, What style and what should people look for in
record stores?

A better question would be, who doesn't produce? Out of the core, the only
people who have not yet appeared on a 2122 comp / record or other techno
label are Doug Holmes, Ed Luna, and  Tony Ramos. Virtually everyone else has 
had their 15 minutes of fame on labels like Metamorphic, Peacefrog, Subbase, 
2000 black, Frictional, Planet E, Multiplex, Phono, 7th City, Contact, 
Spelunk, etc. And there's so much more to come. In specific, look for: 
Titonton Duvante, Charles Noel [archetype, cr02, monochrome], Todd Sines
[.xtrak, cron, enhanced, neriq, trait], Kevin Kennedy [FBK], Kevin Krahel
[Placebo], Kevin Ginger [Valence], Mike Poe [midislut], etc, etc..

7. Kingsize (Subase) and Todd Sines (Peacefrog) were a big part of
ele_mental years ago. Have you found that ele_mental has dealt well with
those people moving on to major techno labels?

I certainly hope so. ;>

8. Monochrome and Titonton Duvante have made impressions on anyone who has
heard a tape or real audio file. Do you find that they amaze people every
time they play out?

Yes, both really have great actor/audience skills and react to the crowd
well. T is just a fool. And I mean that in a good way.

9. What are some projects that ele_mental is currently working on?

More art/music events. A new cron LP will be out in the beginning of 1999
with remixes by Freeform, Solvent, Shake, and BolzBolz.

10. I recall one of your parties where Titonton played with a string
quartet. It was one of the most amazing  and creative things I have ever
witnessed at a party, does he still do that?

Yes, he does. There's talk of recording that collaboration as a separate
project.

11. The layouts and graphics you use are amazing, who does them?

Ed Luna does most of the flyers + web work; Charles does most of the ancillary
design work and 3d / 2d animation. Chris Jones did trace_elements 4, Ed did
t_e 3, Myungho Choi did t_e 2, and I did the cron and t_e 1 EPs, as well as the
first couple flyers for ele_mental events and house parties. And Andromeda
did a few flyers and tape covers as well.

12. Does the ele_mental have any future plans for any parties in the near
future?

Ask Ed. ;>

13. Where can people get more information on ele_mental?
